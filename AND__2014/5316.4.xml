    <abstract>
      <para>There are three types of forest metrics within this database.  They all are derived from the raw Lidar point clouds using the FUSION software. The three types are canopy closure, height metric, and stem mapping.  The canopy closure and height metric grids cover a variety of canopy heights and grid cell sizes.

1. Canopy closure: This metric measures the canopy closure of a given horizontal cell above a given vertical threshold (height break). Canopy closure can inform many landscape models and provide insight on how much light will reach the forest floor.
2. Height Metric: This metric measures the height at which a given percent of the first return points are below. This analysis is done in a given grid cell size. Height metrics give various statistics of the elevation above ground for a given set of Lidar points. In forested landscapes, first return height metrics describe the forest canopy.
3.This stem map locates the approximate center of all trees in the HJ Andrews Research Forest greater than 10 meters. In addition to the stem location, a canopy radius is also provided.

FUSION  and TreeVaWA software programs were used to develop this data.

Watershed Sciences, Inc. (WS) collected Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data from HJ Andrews and the Willamette National Forest (NF) on August 10th and 11th 2008. Total area for this AOI is 17,705 acres. The total area of delivered LiDAR including 100 m buffer is 19,493 acres.</para>

          <para>Using the 0.5m canopy model, some window thresholds between 3 and 23 meters, and a tree height to crown radii relationship the TreeVaW software was used to generate the stem maps. The height to crown radii relationship for 10-60m trees was created from equations in the literature. The 60m and taller trees were not found in the literature so I ran the TreeVaW software to create tree stem greater than 60m. I then used these points to create a relationship which I fed back info TreeVaW for trees greater than 60m.

      <abstract>
        <para>The H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest is a living laboratory that provides unparalleled opportunities for the study of forest and stream ecosystems in the central Cascade Range of Oregon. Since 1980, as a part of the National Science Foundation Long Term Ecological Research (NSF-LTER) program, the Andrews Experimental Forest has become a leader in the analysis of forest and stream ecosystem dynamics.</para> 

<para>Long-term field experiments and measurement programs have focused on climate dynamics, streamflow, water quality, and vegetation succession. Currently researchers are working to develop concepts and tools needed to predict effects of natural disturbance, land use, and climate change on ecosystem structure, function, and species composition. </para>

<para>The Andrews Experimental Forest is administered cooperatively by the USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University and the Willamette National Forest. Funding for the research program comes from the National Science Foundation (NSF), US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University, and other sources.</para></abstract>

          <descriptorValue>The Andrews Forest is situated in the western Cascade Range of Oregon, and covers the entire 15,800-acre (6400-ha) drainage basin of Lookout Creek. Elevation ranges from 1350 to 5340 feet (410 to 1630 m). Broadly representative of the rugged mountainous landscape of the Pacific Northwest, the Andrews Forest contains excellent examples of the region's conifer forests and associated wildlife and stream ecosystems. These forests are among the tallest and most productive in the world, with tree heights of often greater than 250 ft (75 m). Streams are steep, cold and clean, providing habitat for numerous aquatic organisms.</descriptorValue>

      <entityDescription>The canopy closure is derived from the raw Lidar point clouds using the FUSION software. The horizontal resolution is 5 meters, the height threshold is 0 meters, and the upper limit is 2 meters. All Lidar returns were used so that sub canopy vegetation would have an effect on the result. Canopy point density is defined as the proportion of returns between the height threshold and the upper limit. All points above the upper limit are ignored.Watershed Sciences, Inc. (WS) collected Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data from HJ Andrews and the Willamette National Forest (NF) on August 10th and 11th 2008. Total area for this AOI is 17,705 acres. The total area of delivered LiDAR including 100 m buffer is 19,493 acres.</entityDescription>

                                                  collection mission, we conducted multiple static
                                                  (1 Hz recording frequency) ground surveys over
                                                  monuments with known coordinates (Table 1).
                                                  Indexed by time, these GPS data are used to
                                                  correct the continuous onboard measurements of
                                                  aircraft position recorded throughout the mission.
                                                  Multiple sessions were processed over the same
                                                  monument to confirm antenna height measurements
                                                  and reported position accuracy. After the airborne
                                                  survey, these static GPS data were then processed
                                                  using triangulation with Continuously Operating

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using
                                                  the REALM software based on independent data from
                                                  the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and
                                                  aircraft trajectory data (SBET). Laser point
                                                  returns (first through fourth) were assigned an
                                                  associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique
                                                  intensity values (0-255). The data were output
                                                  into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains
                                                  the corresponding scan angle, return number
                                                  (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting, northing,
                                                  and elevation) information. These initial laser
                                                  point files were too large for subsequent
                                                  processing. To facilitate laser point processing,
                                                  bins (polygons) were created to divide the dataset
                                                  into manageable sizes (&lt; 500 MB). Flightlines
                                                  and LiDAR data were then reviewed to ensure
                                                  complete coverage of the study area and positional
                                                  accuracy of the laser points. Laser point data
                                                  were imported into processing bins in TerraScan,
                                                  and manual calibration was performed to assess the
                                                  system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale
                                                  (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship
                                                  developed by Watershed Sciences, each of these
                                                  offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary.
                                                  LiDAR points were then filtered for noise, pits
                                                  (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
                                                  well as erroneously high points) by screening for
                                                  absolute elevation limits, isolated points and
                                                  height above ground. Each bin was then manually
                                                  inspected for remaining pits and birds and
                                                  spurious points were removed. In a bin containing
                                                  approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average
                                                  of 50-100 points are typically found to be
                                                  artificially low or high. Common sources of
                                                  non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor,
                                                  haze, decks, brush piles, etc. Internal
                                                  calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points
                                                  from overlapping lines were tested for internal
                                                  consistency and final adjustments were made for
                                                  system misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading
                                                  offsets and scale). Automated sensor attitude and
                                                  scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in
                                                  the relative accuracy. Once system misalignments
                                                  were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                                                  resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a
                                                  slight improvement (&lt;1 cm) in relative
                                                  accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed
                                                  specifically for classifying near-ground points
                                                  (Soininen, 2004). The processing sequence began by
                                                  âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the
                                                  earth based on geometric constraints used to
                                                  evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare
                                                  earth (ground) model was visually inspected and
                                                  additional ground point modeling was performed in
                                                  site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This
                                                  manual editing of grounds often occurs in areas
                                                  with known ground modeling deficiencies, such as:
                                                  bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream
                                                  banks, and dense vegetation. In some cases,
                                                  automated ground point classification erroneously
                                                  included known vegetation (i.e., understory,
                                                  low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were
                                                  manually reclassified as non-grounds. Ground
                                                  surface rasters were developed from triangulated

                                                  output dataset. It is not uncommon for some types

        <accuracyReport>LiDAR survey datasets were referenced to the 1 Hz static ground GPS data
                collected over presurveyed monuments with known coordinates. While surveying, the
                aircraft collected 2 Hz kinematic GPS data, and the onboard inertial measurement
                unit (IMU) collected 200 Hz aircraft attitude data. Realm Survey Suite was used to
                process the kinematic corrections for the aircraft. The static and kinematic GPS
                data were then post-processed after the survey to obtain an accurate GPS solution
                and aircraft positions. POSPAC was used to develop a trajectory file that includes
                corrected aircraft position and attitude information. The trajectory data for the
                entire flight survey session were incorporated into a final smoothed best estimated
                trajectory (SBET) file that contains accurate and continuous aircraft positions and

          <quantitativeAccuracyMethod>Manual System Calibration: Calibration procedures for each mission require
                solving geometric relationships that relate measured swath-to-swath deviations to
                misalignments of system attitude parameters. Corrected scale, pitch, roll and
                heading offsets were calculated and applied to resolve misalignments. The raw
                divergence between lines was computed after the manual calibration was completed and
                reported for each study area. 2. Automated Attitude Calibration: All data were
                tested and calibrated using TerraMatch automated sampling routines. Ground points
                were classified for each individual flight line and used for line-to-line testing.
                System misalignment offsets (pitch, roll and heading) and scale were solved for each
                individual mission and applied to respective mission datasets. The data from each
                mission were then blended when imported together to form the entire area of
                interest. 3. Automated Z Calibration: Ground points per line were utilized to
                calculate the vertical divergence between lines caused by vertical GPS drift.
                Automated Z calibration was the final step employed for relative accuracy

        <accuracyReport>The vertical accuracy of the LiDAR data is described as the mean and standard
                deviation (sigma ~ Ï) of divergence of LiDAR point coordinates from RTK ground
                survey point coordinates. To provide a sense of the model predictive power of the
                dataset, the root mean square error (RMSE) for vertical accuracy is also provided.
                These statistics assume the error distributions for x, y, and z are normally
                distributed, thus we also consider the skew and kurtosis of distributions when

                terrestrial surfaces only and may not be applied to areas of dense vegetation or

                    multiple static (1 Hz recording frequency) ground surveys over monuments with

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on
                    independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft
                    trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned
                    an associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255).
                    The data were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the
                    corresponding scan angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting,
                    northing, and elevation) information. These initial laser point files were too
                    large for subsequent processing. To facilitate laser point processing, bins
                    (polygons) were created to divide the dataset into manageable sizes (&lt; 500
                    MB). Flightlines and LiDAR data were then reviewed to ensure complete coverage
                    of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. Laser point data
                    were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and manual calibration was
                    performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale
                    (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed Sciences,
                    each of these offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points were
                    then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
                    well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits,
                    isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected
                    for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin
                    containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are
                    typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of
                    non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc.
                    Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines
                    were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system
                    misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor
                    attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative
                    accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                    resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (&lt;1 cm)
                    in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed specifically for
                    classifying near-ground points (Soininen, 2004). The processing sequence began
                    by âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the earth based on geometric
                    constraints used to evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare earth
                    (ground) model was visually inspected and additional ground point modeling was
                    performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This manual editing
                    of grounds often occurs in areas with known ground modeling deficiencies, such
                    as: bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream banks, and dense vegetation.
                    In some cases, automated ground point classification erroneously included known
                    vegetation (i.e., understory, low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were
                    manually reclassified as non-grounds. Ground surface rasters were developed from
                    triangulated irregular networks (TINs) of ground points.</para>

                were classified for each individual flight line and used for line-to-line testing.
                System misalignment offsets (pitch, roll and heading) and scale were solved for each

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on
                    independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft
                    trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned
                    an associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255).
                    The data were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the
                    corresponding scan angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting,
                    northing, and elevation) information. These initial laser point files were too
                    large for subsequent processing. To facilitate laser point processing, bins
                    (polygons) were created to divide the dataset into manageable sizes (&lt; 500
                    MB). Flightlines and LiDAR data were then reviewed to ensure complete coverage
                    of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. Laser point data
                    were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and manual calibration was
                    performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale
                    (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed Sciences,
                    each of these offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points were
                    then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
                    well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits,
                    isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected
                    for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin
                    containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are
                    typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of
                    non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc.
                    Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines
                    were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system
                    misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor
                    attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative
                    accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                    resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (&lt;1 cm)
                    in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed specifically for
                    classifying near-ground points (Soininen, 2004). The processing sequence began
                    by âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the earth based on geometric
                    constraints used to evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare earth
                    (ground) model was visually inspected and additional ground point modeling was
                    performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This manual editing
                    of grounds often occurs in areas with known ground modeling deficiencies, such
                    as: bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream banks, and dense vegetation.
                    In some cases, automated ground point classification erroneously included known
                    vegetation (i.e., understory, low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were
                    manually reclassified as non-grounds. Ground surface rasters were developed from
                    triangulated irregular networks (TINs) of ground points.</para>

        <accuracyReport>LiDAR survey datasets were referenced to the 1 Hz static ground GPS data
                collected over presurveyed monuments with known coordinates. While surveying, the
                aircraft collected 2 Hz kinematic GPS data, and the onboard inertial measurement
                unit (IMU) collected 200 Hz aircraft attitude data. Realm Survey Suite was used to
                process the kinematic corrections for the aircraft. The static and kinematic GPS
                data were then post-processed after the survey to obtain an accurate GPS solution
                and aircraft positions. POSPAC was used to develop a trajectory file that includes
                corrected aircraft position and attitude information. The trajectory data for the
                entire flight survey session were incorporated into a final smoothed best estimated

                solving geometric relationships that relate measured swath-to-swath deviations to
                misalignments of system attitude parameters. Corrected scale, pitch, roll and
                heading offsets were calculated and applied to resolve misalignments. The raw
                divergence between lines was computed after the manual calibration was completed and
                reported for each study area. 2. Automated Attitude Calibration: All data were
                tested and calibrated using TerraMatch automated sampling routines. Ground points
                were classified for each individual flight line and used for line-to-line testing.
                System misalignment offsets (pitch, roll and heading) and scale were solved for each
                individual mission and applied to respective mission datasets. The data from each
                mission were then blended when imported together to form the entire area of
                interest. 3. Automated Z Calibration: Ground points per line were utilized to
                calculate the vertical divergence between lines caused by vertical GPS drift.

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on
                    independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft
                    trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned
                    an associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255).
                    The data were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the
                    corresponding scan angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting,
                    northing, and elevation) information. These initial laser point files were too
                    large for subsequent processing. To facilitate laser point processing, bins
                    (polygons) were created to divide the dataset into manageable sizes (&lt; 500
                    MB). Flightlines and LiDAR data were then reviewed to ensure complete coverage
                    of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. Laser point data
                    were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and manual calibration was
                    performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale
                    (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed Sciences,
                    each of these offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points were
                    then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
                    well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits,
                    isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected
                    for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin
                    containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are
                    typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of
                    non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc.
                    Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines
                    were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system
                    misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor
                    attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative
                    accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                    resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (&lt;1 cm)
                    in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed specifically for
                    classifying near-ground points (Soininen, 2004). The processing sequence began
                    by âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the earth based on geometric
                    constraints used to evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare earth
                    (ground) model was visually inspected and additional ground point modeling was
                    performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This manual editing
                    of grounds often occurs in areas with known ground modeling deficiencies, such
                    as: bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream banks, and dense vegetation.
                    In some cases, automated ground point classification erroneously included known
                    vegetation (i.e., understory, low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were
                    manually reclassified as non-grounds. Ground surface rasters were developed from
                    triangulated irregular networks (TINs) of ground points.</para>

            <para>The LiDAR survey uses a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. For the HJ
                    Andrews and Willamette NF study areas, the sensor scan angle was Â±14o from
                    nadir1 with a pulse rate designed to yield an average native density (number of
                    pulses emitted by the laser system) of 8 points per square meter over
                    terrestrial surfaces. All study areas were surveyed with an opposing flight line
                    side-lap of =50% (=100% overlap) to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface
                    laser painting. The Leica ALS50 Phase II system allows up to four range
                    measurements (returns) per pulse, and all discernable laser returns were
                    processed for the output dataset. It is not uncommon for some types of surfaces
                    (e.g. dense vegetation or water) to return fewer pulses than the laser
                    originally emitted. These discrepancies between ânativeâ and âdeliveredâ density
                    will vary depending on terrain, land cover and the prevalence of water bodies.
                    To accurately solve for laser point position (geographic coordinates x, y, z),
                    the positional coordinates of the airborne sensor and the attitude of the
                    aircraft were recorded continuously throughout the LiDAR data collection
                    mission. Aircraft position was measured twice per second (2 Hz) by an onboard
                    differential GPS unit. Aircraft attitude was measured 200 times per second (200

        <accuracyReport>LiDAR survey datasets were referenced to the 1 Hz static ground GPS data
                collected over presurveyed monuments with known coordinates. While surveying, the
                aircraft collected 2 Hz kinematic GPS data, and the onboard inertial measurement
                unit (IMU) collected 200 Hz aircraft attitude data. Realm Survey Suite was used to
                process the kinematic corrections for the aircraft. The static and kinematic GPS
                data were then post-processed after the survey to obtain an accurate GPS solution
                and aircraft positions. POSPAC was used to develop a trajectory file that includes
                corrected aircraft position and attitude information. The trajectory data for the
                entire flight survey session were incorporated into a final smoothed best estimated
                trajectory (SBET) file that contains accurate and continuous aircraft positions and

          <quantitativeAccuracyMethod>Manual System Calibration: Calibration procedures for each mission require
                solving geometric relationships that relate measured swath-to-swath deviations to
                misalignments of system attitude parameters. Corrected scale, pitch, roll and
                heading offsets were calculated and applied to resolve misalignments. The raw
                divergence between lines was computed after the manual calibration was completed and
                reported for each study area. 2. Automated Attitude Calibration: All data were
                tested and calibrated using TerraMatch automated sampling routines. Ground points
                were classified for each individual flight line and used for line-to-line testing.
                System misalignment offsets (pitch, roll and heading) and scale were solved for each
                individual mission and applied to respective mission datasets. The data from each
                mission were then blended when imported together to form the entire area of
                interest. 3. Automated Z Calibration: Ground points per line were utilized to
                calculate the vertical divergence between lines caused by vertical GPS drift.
                Automated Z calibration was the final step employed for relative accuracy

        <accuracyReport>The vertical accuracy of the LiDAR data is described as the mean and standard
                deviation (sigma ~ Ï) of divergence of LiDAR point coordinates from RTK ground

                    multiple static (1 Hz recording frequency) ground surveys over monuments with

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on
                    independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft
                    trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned
                    an associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255).
                    The data were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the
                    corresponding scan angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting,
                    northing, and elevation) information. These initial laser point files were too
                    large for subsequent processing. To facilitate laser point processing, bins
                    (polygons) were created to divide the dataset into manageable sizes (&lt; 500
                    MB). Flightlines and LiDAR data were then reviewed to ensure complete coverage
                    of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. Laser point data
                    were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and manual calibration was
                    performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale
                    (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed Sciences,
                    each of these offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points were
                    then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
                    well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits,
                    isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected
                    for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin
                    containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are
                    typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of
                    non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc.
                    Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines
                    were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system
                    misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor
                    attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative
                    accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                    resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (&lt;1 cm)
                    in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed specifically for
                    classifying near-ground points (Soininen, 2004). The processing sequence began
                    by âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the earth based on geometric
                    constraints used to evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare earth
                    (ground) model was visually inspected and additional ground point modeling was
                    performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This manual editing
                    of grounds often occurs in areas with known ground modeling deficiencies, such
                    as: bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream banks, and dense vegetation.
                    In some cases, automated ground point classification erroneously included known
                    vegetation (i.e., understory, low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were
                    manually reclassified as non-grounds. Ground surface rasters were developed from
                    triangulated irregular networks (TINs) of ground points.</para>

            <para>The LiDAR survey uses a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. For the HJ
                    Andrews and Willamette NF study areas, the sensor scan angle was Â±14o from
                    nadir1 with a pulse rate designed to yield an average native density (number of
                    pulses emitted by the laser system) of 8 points per square meter over
                    terrestrial surfaces. All study areas were surveyed with an opposing flight line
                    side-lap of =50% (=100% overlap) to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface
                    laser painting. The Leica ALS50 Phase II system allows up to four range
                    measurements (returns) per pulse, and all discernable laser returns were
                    processed for the output dataset. It is not uncommon for some types of surfaces
                    (e.g. dense vegetation or water) to return fewer pulses than the laser
                    originally emitted. These discrepancies between ânativeâ and âdeliveredâ density
                    will vary depending on terrain, land cover and the prevalence of water bodies.
                    To accurately solve for laser point position (geographic coordinates x, y, z),
                    the positional coordinates of the airborne sensor and the attitude of the

                    mission. Aircraft position was measured twice per second (2 Hz) by an onboard
                    differential GPS unit. Aircraft attitude was measured 200 times per second (200
                    Hz) as pitch, roll and yaw (heading) from an onboard inertial measurement unit
                    (IMU). To allow for post-processing correction and calibration, aircraft/sensor

        <accuracyReport>LiDAR survey datasets were referenced to the 1 Hz static ground GPS data
                collected over presurveyed monuments with known coordinates. While surveying, the
                aircraft collected 2 Hz kinematic GPS data, and the onboard inertial measurement
                unit (IMU) collected 200 Hz aircraft attitude data. Realm Survey Suite was used to
                process the kinematic corrections for the aircraft. The static and kinematic GPS
                data were then post-processed after the survey to obtain an accurate GPS solution
                and aircraft positions. POSPAC was used to develop a trajectory file that includes
                corrected aircraft position and attitude information. The trajectory data for the
                entire flight survey session were incorporated into a final smoothed best estimated
                trajectory (SBET) file that contains accurate and continuous aircraft positions and

          <quantitativeAccuracyMethod>Manual System Calibration: Calibration procedures for each mission require
                solving geometric relationships that relate measured swath-to-swath deviations to
                misalignments of system attitude parameters. Corrected scale, pitch, roll and
                heading offsets were calculated and applied to resolve misalignments. The raw
                divergence between lines was computed after the manual calibration was completed and
                reported for each study area. 2. Automated Attitude Calibration: All data were
                tested and calibrated using TerraMatch automated sampling routines. Ground points
                were classified for each individual flight line and used for line-to-line testing.
                System misalignment offsets (pitch, roll and heading) and scale were solved for each
                individual mission and applied to respective mission datasets. The data from each
                mission were then blended when imported together to form the entire area of
                interest. 3. Automated Z Calibration: Ground points per line were utilized to
                calculate the vertical divergence between lines caused by vertical GPS drift.
                Automated Z calibration was the final step employed for relative accuracy

        <accuracyReport>The vertical accuracy of the LiDAR data is described as the mean and standard
                deviation (sigma ~ Ï) of divergence of LiDAR point coordinates from RTK ground
                survey point coordinates. To provide a sense of the model predictive power of the
                dataset, the root mean square error (RMSE) for vertical accuracy is also provided.
                These statistics assume the error distributions for x, y, and z are normally
                distributed, thus we also consider the skew and kurtosis of distributions when

            <para>Simultaneous with the airborne data collection mission, we conducted
                    multiple static (1 Hz recording frequency) ground surveys over monuments with

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on
                    independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft
                    trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned
                    an associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255).
                    The data were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the
                    corresponding scan angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting,
                    northing, and elevation) information. These initial laser point files were too
                    large for subsequent processing. To facilitate laser point processing, bins
                    (polygons) were created to divide the dataset into manageable sizes (&lt; 500
                    MB). Flightlines and LiDAR data were then reviewed to ensure complete coverage
                    of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. Laser point data
                    were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and manual calibration was
                    performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale
                    (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed Sciences,
                    each of these offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points were
                    then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
                    well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits,
                    isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected
                    for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin
                    containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are
                    typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of
                    non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc.
                    Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines
                    were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system
                    misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor
                    attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative
                    accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                    resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (&lt;1 cm)
                    in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed specifically for
                    classifying near-ground points (Soininen, 2004). The processing sequence began
                    by âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the earth based on geometric
                    constraints used to evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare earth
                    (ground) model was visually inspected and additional ground point modeling was
                    performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This manual editing
                    of grounds often occurs in areas with known ground modeling deficiencies, such
                    as: bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream banks, and dense vegetation.
                    In some cases, automated ground point classification erroneously included known
                    vegetation (i.e., understory, low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were
                    manually reclassified as non-grounds. Ground surface rasters were developed from
                    triangulated irregular networks (TINs) of ground points.</para>

            <para>The LiDAR survey uses a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. For the HJ
                    Andrews and Willamette NF study areas, the sensor scan angle was Â±14o from
                    nadir1 with a pulse rate designed to yield an average native density (number of
                    pulses emitted by the laser system) of 8 points per square meter over
                    terrestrial surfaces. All study areas were surveyed with an opposing flight line
                    side-lap of =50% (=100% overlap) to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface
                    laser painting. The Leica ALS50 Phase II system allows up to four range
                    measurements (returns) per pulse, and all discernable laser returns were
                    processed for the output dataset. It is not uncommon for some types of surfaces
                    (e.g. dense vegetation or water) to return fewer pulses than the laser
                    originally emitted. These discrepancies between ânativeâ and âdeliveredâ density
                    will vary depending on terrain, land cover and the prevalence of water bodies.
                    To accurately solve for laser point position (geographic coordinates x, y, z),
                    the positional coordinates of the airborne sensor and the attitude of the

                    mission. Aircraft position was measured twice per second (2 Hz) by an onboard
                    differential GPS unit. Aircraft attitude was measured 200 times per second (200
                    Hz) as pitch, roll and yaw (heading) from an onboard inertial measurement unit
                    (IMU). To allow for post-processing correction and calibration, aircraft/sensor
                    position and attitude data are indexed by GPS time</para>

                collected over presurveyed monuments with known coordinates. While surveying, the
                aircraft collected 2 Hz kinematic GPS data, and the onboard inertial measurement
                unit (IMU) collected 200 Hz aircraft attitude data. Realm Survey Suite was used to

                corrected aircraft position and attitude information. The trajectory data for the
                entire flight survey session were incorporated into a final smoothed best estimated
                trajectory (SBET) file that contains accurate and continuous aircraft positions and
                attitudes.</accuracyReport>

          <quantitativeAccuracyMethod>Manual System Calibration: Calibration procedures for each mission require
                solving geometric relationships that relate measured swath-to-swath deviations to
                misalignments of system attitude parameters. Corrected scale, pitch, roll and
                heading offsets were calculated and applied to resolve misalignments. The raw
                divergence between lines was computed after the manual calibration was completed and
                reported for each study area. 2. Automated Attitude Calibration: All data were
                tested and calibrated using TerraMatch automated sampling routines. Ground points
                were classified for each individual flight line and used for line-to-line testing.
                System misalignment offsets (pitch, roll and heading) and scale were solved for each
                individual mission and applied to respective mission datasets. The data from each
                mission were then blended when imported together to form the entire area of
                interest. 3. Automated Z Calibration: Ground points per line were utilized to
                calculate the vertical divergence between lines caused by vertical GPS drift.
                Automated Z calibration was the final step employed for relative accuracy

                    multiple static (1 Hz recording frequency) ground surveys over monuments with
                    known coordinates (Table 1). Indexed by time, these GPS data are used to correct

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on
                    independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft
                    trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned
                    an associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255).
                    The data were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the
                    corresponding scan angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting,
                    northing, and elevation) information. These initial laser point files were too
                    large for subsequent processing. To facilitate laser point processing, bins
                    (polygons) were created to divide the dataset into manageable sizes (&lt; 500
                    MB). Flightlines and LiDAR data were then reviewed to ensure complete coverage
                    of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. Laser point data
                    were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and manual calibration was
                    performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale
                    (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed Sciences,
                    each of these offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points were
                    then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
                    well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits,
                    isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected
                    for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin
                    containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are
                    typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of
                    non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc.
                    Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines
                    were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system
                    misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor
                    attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative
                    accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                    resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (&lt;1 cm)
                    in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed specifically for
                    classifying near-ground points (Soininen, 2004). The processing sequence began
                    by âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the earth based on geometric
                    constraints used to evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare earth
                    (ground) model was visually inspected and additional ground point modeling was
                    performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This manual editing
                    of grounds often occurs in areas with known ground modeling deficiencies, such
                    as: bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream banks, and dense vegetation.
                    In some cases, automated ground point classification erroneously included known
                    vegetation (i.e., understory, low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were
                    manually reclassified as non-grounds. Ground surface rasters were developed from
                    triangulated irregular networks (TINs) of ground points.</para>

            <para>The LiDAR survey uses a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. For the HJ
                    Andrews and Willamette NF study areas, the sensor scan angle was Â±14o from
                    nadir1 with a pulse rate designed to yield an average native density (number of
                    pulses emitted by the laser system) of 8 points per square meter over
                    terrestrial surfaces. All study areas were surveyed with an opposing flight line
                    side-lap of =50% (=100% overlap) to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface
                    laser painting. The Leica ALS50 Phase II system allows up to four range
                    measurements (returns) per pulse, and all discernable laser returns were
                    processed for the output dataset. It is not uncommon for some types of surfaces
                    (e.g. dense vegetation or water) to return fewer pulses than the laser
                    originally emitted. These discrepancies between ânativeâ and âdeliveredâ density
                    will vary depending on terrain, land cover and the prevalence of water bodies.
                    To accurately solve for laser point position (geographic coordinates x, y, z),
                    the positional coordinates of the airborne sensor and the attitude of the
                    aircraft were recorded continuously throughout the LiDAR data collection
                    mission. Aircraft position was measured twice per second (2 Hz) by an onboard
                    differential GPS unit. Aircraft attitude was measured 200 times per second (200
                    Hz) as pitch, roll and yaw (heading) from an onboard inertial measurement unit
                    (IMU). To allow for post-processing correction and calibration, aircraft/sensor
                    position and attitude data are indexed by GPS time</para>

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on
                    independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft
                    trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned
                    an associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255).
                    The data were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the
                    corresponding scan angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting,
                    northing, and elevation) information. These initial laser point files were too
                    large for subsequent processing. To facilitate laser point processing, bins
                    (polygons) were created to divide the dataset into manageable sizes (&lt; 500
                    MB). Flightlines and LiDAR data were then reviewed to ensure complete coverage
                    of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. Laser point data
                    were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and manual calibration was
                    performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale
                    (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed Sciences,
                    each of these offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points were
                    then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
                    well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits,
                    isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected
                    for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin
                    containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are
                    typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of
                    non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc.
                    Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines
                    were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system
                    misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor
                    attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative
                    accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                    resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (&lt;1 cm)
                    in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed specifically for
                    classifying near-ground points (Soininen, 2004). The processing sequence began
                    by âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the earth based on geometric
                    constraints used to evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare earth
                    (ground) model was visually inspected and additional ground point modeling was
                    performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This manual editing
                    of grounds often occurs in areas with known ground modeling deficiencies, such
                    as: bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream banks, and dense vegetation.
                    In some cases, automated ground point classification erroneously included known
                    vegetation (i.e., understory, low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were
                    manually reclassified as non-grounds. Ground surface rasters were developed from
                    triangulated irregular networks (TINs) of ground points.</para>

            <para>The LiDAR survey uses a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. For the HJ
                    Andrews and Willamette NF study areas, the sensor scan angle was Â±14o from
                    nadir1 with a pulse rate designed to yield an average native density (number of
                    pulses emitted by the laser system) of 8 points per square meter over
                    terrestrial surfaces. All study areas were surveyed with an opposing flight line
                    side-lap of =50% (=100% overlap) to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface
                    laser painting. The Leica ALS50 Phase II system allows up to four range
                    measurements (returns) per pulse, and all discernable laser returns were
                    processed for the output dataset. It is not uncommon for some types of surfaces
                    (e.g. dense vegetation or water) to return fewer pulses than the laser
                    originally emitted. These discrepancies between ânativeâ and âdeliveredâ density
                    will vary depending on terrain, land cover and the prevalence of water bodies.
                    To accurately solve for laser point position (geographic coordinates x, y, z),
                    the positional coordinates of the airborne sensor and the attitude of the
                    aircraft were recorded continuously throughout the LiDAR data collection
                    mission. Aircraft position was measured twice per second (2 Hz) by an onboard
                    differential GPS unit. Aircraft attitude was measured 200 times per second (200
                    Hz) as pitch, roll and yaw (heading) from an onboard inertial measurement unit
                    (IMU). To allow for post-processing correction and calibration, aircraft/sensor
                    position and attitude data are indexed by GPS time</para>

Also, a bare earth DTM was created from the Watershed Sciences 1m Bare Earth raster. This is used to normalize the Lidar points to height above ground so the height thresholds can be assessed. The GRIDMETRICS command was run with a python script (runFusion_height3.py). The Lidar data were tiled into pieces small enough to process and then clipped back to remove erronious edges.

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on
                    independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft
                    trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned
                    an associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255).
                    The data were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the
                    corresponding scan angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting,
                    northing, and elevation) information. These initial laser point files were too
                    large for subsequent processing. To facilitate laser point processing, bins
                    (polygons) were created to divide the dataset into manageable sizes (&lt; 500
                    MB). Flightlines and LiDAR data were then reviewed to ensure complete coverage
                    of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. Laser point data
                    were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and manual calibration was
                    performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale
                    (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed Sciences,
                    each of these offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points were
                    then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
                    well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits,
                    isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected
                    for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin
                    containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are
                    typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of
                    non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc.
                    Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines
                    were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system
                    misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor
                    attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative
                    accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                    resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (&lt;1 cm)
                    in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed specifically for
                    classifying near-ground points (Soininen, 2004). The processing sequence began
                    by âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the earth based on geometric
                    constraints used to evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare earth
                    (ground) model was visually inspected and additional ground point modeling was
                    performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This manual editing
                    of grounds often occurs in areas with known ground modeling deficiencies, such
                    as: bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream banks, and dense vegetation.
                    In some cases, automated ground point classification erroneously included known
                    vegetation (i.e., understory, low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were
                    manually reclassified as non-grounds. Ground surface rasters were developed from
                    triangulated irregular networks (TINs) of ground points.</para>

            <para>The LiDAR survey uses a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. For the HJ
                    Andrews and Willamette NF study areas, the sensor scan angle was Â±14o from
                    nadir1 with a pulse rate designed to yield an average native density (number of
                    pulses emitted by the laser system) of 8 points per square meter over
                    terrestrial surfaces. All study areas were surveyed with an opposing flight line
                    side-lap of =50% (=100% overlap) to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface
                    laser painting. The Leica ALS50 Phase II system allows up to four range
                    measurements (returns) per pulse, and all discernable laser returns were
                    processed for the output dataset. It is not uncommon for some types of surfaces
                    (e.g. dense vegetation or water) to return fewer pulses than the laser
                    originally emitted. These discrepancies between ânativeâ and âdeliveredâ density
                    will vary depending on terrain, land cover and the prevalence of water bodies.
                    To accurately solve for laser point position (geographic coordinates x, y, z),
                    the positional coordinates of the airborne sensor and the attitude of the
                    aircraft were recorded continuously throughout the LiDAR data collection
                    mission. Aircraft position was measured twice per second (2 Hz) by an onboard
                    differential GPS unit. Aircraft attitude was measured 200 times per second (200
                    Hz) as pitch, roll and yaw (heading) from an onboard inertial measurement unit
                    (IMU). To allow for post-processing correction and calibration, aircraft/sensor
                    position and attitude data are indexed by GPS time</para>

Also, a bare earth DTM was created from the Watershed Sciences 1m Bare Earth raster. This is used to normalize the Lidar points to height above ground so the height thresholds can be assessed. The GRIDMETRICS command was run with a python script (runFusion_height3.py). The Lidar data were tiled into pieces small enough to process and then clipped back to remove erronious edges.

                collected over presurveyed monuments with known coordinates. While surveying, the
                aircraft collected 2 Hz kinematic GPS data, and the onboard inertial measurement
                unit (IMU) collected 200 Hz aircraft attitude data. Realm Survey Suite was used to
                process the kinematic corrections for the aircraft. The static and kinematic GPS
                data were then post-processed after the survey to obtain an accurate GPS solution

                divergence between lines was computed after the manual calibration was completed and
                reported for each study area. 2. Automated Attitude Calibration: All data were

                were classified for each individual flight line and used for line-to-line testing.
                System misalignment offsets (pitch, roll and heading) and scale were solved for each

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on
                    independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft
                    trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned
                    an associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255).
                    The data were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the
                    corresponding scan angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting,
                    northing, and elevation) information. These initial laser point files were too
                    large for subsequent processing. To facilitate laser point processing, bins
                    (polygons) were created to divide the dataset into manageable sizes (&lt; 500
                    MB). Flightlines and LiDAR data were then reviewed to ensure complete coverage
                    of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. Laser point data
                    were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and manual calibration was
                    performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale
                    (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed Sciences,
                    each of these offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points were
                    then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
                    well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits,
                    isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected
                    for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin
                    containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are
                    typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of
                    non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc.
                    Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines
                    were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system
                    misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor
                    attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative
                    accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                    resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (&lt;1 cm)
                    in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed specifically for
                    classifying near-ground points (Soininen, 2004). The processing sequence began
                    by âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the earth based on geometric
                    constraints used to evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare earth
                    (ground) model was visually inspected and additional ground point modeling was
                    performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This manual editing
                    of grounds often occurs in areas with known ground modeling deficiencies, such
                    as: bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream banks, and dense vegetation.
                    In some cases, automated ground point classification erroneously included known
                    vegetation (i.e., understory, low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were
                    manually reclassified as non-grounds. Ground surface rasters were developed from
                    triangulated irregular networks (TINs) of ground points.</para>

                    measurements (returns) per pulse, and all discernable laser returns were
                    processed for the output dataset. It is not uncommon for some types of surfaces
                    (e.g. dense vegetation or water) to return fewer pulses than the laser
                    originally emitted. These discrepancies between ânativeâ and âdeliveredâ density
                    will vary depending on terrain, land cover and the prevalence of water bodies.

                    Hz) as pitch, roll and yaw (heading) from an onboard inertial measurement unit
                    (IMU). To allow for post-processing correction and calibration, aircraft/sensor

Also, a bare earth DTM was created from the Watershed Sciences 1m Bare Earth raster. This is used to normalize the Lidar points to height above ground so the height thresholds can be assessed. The GRIDMETRICS command was run with a python script (runFusion_height3.py). The Lidar data were tiled into pieces small enough to process and then clipped back to remove erronious edges.

                heading offsets were calculated and applied to resolve misalignments. The raw
                divergence between lines was computed after the manual calibration was completed and
                reported for each study area. 2. Automated Attitude Calibration: All data were
                tested and calibrated using TerraMatch automated sampling routines. Ground points
                were classified for each individual flight line and used for line-to-line testing.
                System misalignment offsets (pitch, roll and heading) and scale were solved for each

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on
                    independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft
                    trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned
                    an associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255).
                    The data were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the
                    corresponding scan angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting,
                    northing, and elevation) information. These initial laser point files were too
                    large for subsequent processing. To facilitate laser point processing, bins
                    (polygons) were created to divide the dataset into manageable sizes (&lt; 500
                    MB). Flightlines and LiDAR data were then reviewed to ensure complete coverage
                    of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. Laser point data
                    were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and manual calibration was
                    performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale
                    (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed Sciences,
                    each of these offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points were
                    then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
                    well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits,
                    isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected
                    for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin
                    containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are
                    typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of
                    non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc.
                    Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines
                    were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system
                    misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor
                    attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative
                    accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                    resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (&lt;1 cm)
                    in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed specifically for
                    classifying near-ground points (Soininen, 2004). The processing sequence began
                    by âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the earth based on geometric
                    constraints used to evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare earth
                    (ground) model was visually inspected and additional ground point modeling was
                    performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This manual editing
                    of grounds often occurs in areas with known ground modeling deficiencies, such
                    as: bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream banks, and dense vegetation.
                    In some cases, automated ground point classification erroneously included known
                    vegetation (i.e., understory, low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were
                    manually reclassified as non-grounds. Ground surface rasters were developed from
                    triangulated irregular networks (TINs) of ground points.</para>

                    originally emitted. These discrepancies between ânativeâ and âdeliveredâ density
                    will vary depending on terrain, land cover and the prevalence of water bodies.
                    To accurately solve for laser point position (geographic coordinates x, y, z),
                    the positional coordinates of the airborne sensor and the attitude of the
                    aircraft were recorded continuously throughout the LiDAR data collection
                    mission. Aircraft position was measured twice per second (2 Hz) by an onboard
                    differential GPS unit. Aircraft attitude was measured 200 times per second (200
                    Hz) as pitch, roll and yaw (heading) from an onboard inertial measurement unit
                    (IMU). To allow for post-processing correction and calibration, aircraft/sensor
                    position and attitude data are indexed by GPS time</para>

            <para>Mean height was computed with the FUSION software. See below for an example of the GRIDMETRICS command in FUSION. Projection info was copied from the Lidar dataset. Also, a bare earth DTM was created from the Watershed Sciences 1m Bare Earth raster. This is used to normalize the Lidar points to height above ground so the height thresholds can be assessed. The GRIDMETRICS command was run with a python script (runFusion_height3.py). The Lidar data were tiled into pieces small enough to process and then clipped back to remove erronious edges.

        <accuracyReport>LiDAR survey datasets were referenced to the 1 Hz static ground GPS data
                collected over presurveyed monuments with known coordinates. While surveying, the
                aircraft collected 2 Hz kinematic GPS data, and the onboard inertial measurement
                unit (IMU) collected 200 Hz aircraft attitude data. Realm Survey Suite was used to
                process the kinematic corrections for the aircraft. The static and kinematic GPS
                data were then post-processed after the survey to obtain an accurate GPS solution
                and aircraft positions. POSPAC was used to develop a trajectory file that includes
                corrected aircraft position and attitude information. The trajectory data for the
                entire flight survey session were incorporated into a final smoothed best estimated

                misalignments of system attitude parameters. Corrected scale, pitch, roll and
                heading offsets were calculated and applied to resolve misalignments. The raw
                divergence between lines was computed after the manual calibration was completed and
                reported for each study area. 2. Automated Attitude Calibration: All data were
                tested and calibrated using TerraMatch automated sampling routines. Ground points
                were classified for each individual flight line and used for line-to-line testing.
                System misalignment offsets (pitch, roll and heading) and scale were solved for each
                individual mission and applied to respective mission datasets. The data from each
                mission were then blended when imported together to form the entire area of
                interest. 3. Automated Z Calibration: Ground points per line were utilized to
                calculate the vertical divergence between lines caused by vertical GPS drift.

            <para>Simultaneous with the airborne data collection mission, we conducted
                    multiple static (1 Hz recording frequency) ground surveys over monuments with

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on
                    independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft
                    trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned
                    an associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255).
                    The data were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the
                    corresponding scan angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting,
                    northing, and elevation) information. These initial laser point files were too
                    large for subsequent processing. To facilitate laser point processing, bins
                    (polygons) were created to divide the dataset into manageable sizes (&lt; 500
                    MB). Flightlines and LiDAR data were then reviewed to ensure complete coverage
                    of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. Laser point data
                    were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and manual calibration was
                    performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale
                    (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed Sciences,
                    each of these offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points were
                    then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
                    well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits,
                    isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected
                    for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin
                    containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are
                    typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of
                    non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc.
                    Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines
                    were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system
                    misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor
                    attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative
                    accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                    resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (&lt;1 cm)
                    in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed specifically for
                    classifying near-ground points (Soininen, 2004). The processing sequence began
                    by âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the earth based on geometric
                    constraints used to evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare earth
                    (ground) model was visually inspected and additional ground point modeling was
                    performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This manual editing
                    of grounds often occurs in areas with known ground modeling deficiencies, such
                    as: bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream banks, and dense vegetation.
                    In some cases, automated ground point classification erroneously included known
                    vegetation (i.e., understory, low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were
                    manually reclassified as non-grounds. Ground surface rasters were developed from
                    triangulated irregular networks (TINs) of ground points.</para>

            <para>The LiDAR survey uses a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. For the HJ
                    Andrews and Willamette NF study areas, the sensor scan angle was Â±14o from
                    nadir1 with a pulse rate designed to yield an average native density (number of
                    pulses emitted by the laser system) of 8 points per square meter over
                    terrestrial surfaces. All study areas were surveyed with an opposing flight line
                    side-lap of =50% (=100% overlap) to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface
                    laser painting. The Leica ALS50 Phase II system allows up to four range
                    measurements (returns) per pulse, and all discernable laser returns were
                    processed for the output dataset. It is not uncommon for some types of surfaces
                    (e.g. dense vegetation or water) to return fewer pulses than the laser
                    originally emitted. These discrepancies between ânativeâ and âdeliveredâ density

                    the positional coordinates of the airborne sensor and the attitude of the
                    aircraft were recorded continuously throughout the LiDAR data collection
                    mission. Aircraft position was measured twice per second (2 Hz) by an onboard
                    differential GPS unit. Aircraft attitude was measured 200 times per second (200
                    Hz) as pitch, roll and yaw (heading) from an onboard inertial measurement unit
                    (IMU). To allow for post-processing correction and calibration, aircraft/sensor
                    position and attitude data are indexed by GPS time</para>

Also, a bare earth DTM was created from the Watershed Sciences 1m Bare Earth raster. This is used to normalize the Lidar points to height above ground so the height thresholds can be assessed. The GRIDMETRICS command was run with a python script (runFusion_height3.py). The Lidar data were tiled into pieces small enough to process and then clipped back to remove erronious edges.

        <accuracyReport>LiDAR survey datasets were referenced to the 1 Hz static ground GPS data
                collected over presurveyed monuments with known coordinates. While surveying, the
                aircraft collected 2 Hz kinematic GPS data, and the onboard inertial measurement
                unit (IMU) collected 200 Hz aircraft attitude data. Realm Survey Suite was used to
                process the kinematic corrections for the aircraft. The static and kinematic GPS
                data were then post-processed after the survey to obtain an accurate GPS solution
                and aircraft positions. POSPAC was used to develop a trajectory file that includes
                corrected aircraft position and attitude information. The trajectory data for the
                entire flight survey session were incorporated into a final smoothed best estimated
                trajectory (SBET) file that contains accurate and continuous aircraft positions and

                solving geometric relationships that relate measured swath-to-swath deviations to
                misalignments of system attitude parameters. Corrected scale, pitch, roll and
                heading offsets were calculated and applied to resolve misalignments. The raw
                divergence between lines was computed after the manual calibration was completed and
                reported for each study area. 2. Automated Attitude Calibration: All data were
                tested and calibrated using TerraMatch automated sampling routines. Ground points
                were classified for each individual flight line and used for line-to-line testing.
                System misalignment offsets (pitch, roll and heading) and scale were solved for each
                individual mission and applied to respective mission datasets. The data from each
                mission were then blended when imported together to form the entire area of
                interest. 3. Automated Z Calibration: Ground points per line were utilized to
                calculate the vertical divergence between lines caused by vertical GPS drift.

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on
                    independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft
                    trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned
                    an associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255).
                    The data were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the
                    corresponding scan angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting,
                    northing, and elevation) information. These initial laser point files were too
                    large for subsequent processing. To facilitate laser point processing, bins
                    (polygons) were created to divide the dataset into manageable sizes (&lt; 500
                    MB). Flightlines and LiDAR data were then reviewed to ensure complete coverage
                    of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. Laser point data
                    were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and manual calibration was
                    performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale
                    (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed Sciences,
                    each of these offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points were
                    then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
                    well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits,
                    isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected
                    for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin
                    containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are
                    typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of
                    non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc.
                    Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines
                    were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system
                    misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor
                    attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative
                    accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                    resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (&lt;1 cm)
                    in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed specifically for
                    classifying near-ground points (Soininen, 2004). The processing sequence began
                    by âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the earth based on geometric
                    constraints used to evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare earth
                    (ground) model was visually inspected and additional ground point modeling was
                    performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This manual editing
                    of grounds often occurs in areas with known ground modeling deficiencies, such
                    as: bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream banks, and dense vegetation.
                    In some cases, automated ground point classification erroneously included known
                    vegetation (i.e., understory, low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were
                    manually reclassified as non-grounds. Ground surface rasters were developed from
                    triangulated irregular networks (TINs) of ground points.</para>

            <para>The LiDAR survey uses a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. For the HJ
                    Andrews and Willamette NF study areas, the sensor scan angle was Â±14o from
                    nadir1 with a pulse rate designed to yield an average native density (number of
                    pulses emitted by the laser system) of 8 points per square meter over
                    terrestrial surfaces. All study areas were surveyed with an opposing flight line
                    side-lap of =50% (=100% overlap) to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface
                    laser painting. The Leica ALS50 Phase II system allows up to four range
                    measurements (returns) per pulse, and all discernable laser returns were
                    processed for the output dataset. It is not uncommon for some types of surfaces
                    (e.g. dense vegetation or water) to return fewer pulses than the laser
                    originally emitted. These discrepancies between ânativeâ and âdeliveredâ density
                    will vary depending on terrain, land cover and the prevalence of water bodies.

                    (IMU). To allow for post-processing correction and calibration, aircraft/sensor

        <accuracyReport>LiDAR survey datasets were referenced to the 1 Hz static ground GPS data
                collected over presurveyed monuments with known coordinates. While surveying, the
                aircraft collected 2 Hz kinematic GPS data, and the onboard inertial measurement
                unit (IMU) collected 200 Hz aircraft attitude data. Realm Survey Suite was used to
                process the kinematic corrections for the aircraft. The static and kinematic GPS
                data were then post-processed after the survey to obtain an accurate GPS solution
                and aircraft positions. POSPAC was used to develop a trajectory file that includes
                corrected aircraft position and attitude information. The trajectory data for the
                entire flight survey session were incorporated into a final smoothed best estimated
                trajectory (SBET) file that contains accurate and continuous aircraft positions and

          <quantitativeAccuracyMethod>Manual System Calibration: Calibration procedures for each mission require
                solving geometric relationships that relate measured swath-to-swath deviations to
                misalignments of system attitude parameters. Corrected scale, pitch, roll and
                heading offsets were calculated and applied to resolve misalignments. The raw
                divergence between lines was computed after the manual calibration was completed and
                reported for each study area. 2. Automated Attitude Calibration: All data were
                tested and calibrated using TerraMatch automated sampling routines. Ground points
                were classified for each individual flight line and used for line-to-line testing.
                System misalignment offsets (pitch, roll and heading) and scale were solved for each
                individual mission and applied to respective mission datasets. The data from each
                mission were then blended when imported together to form the entire area of
                interest. 3. Automated Z Calibration: Ground points per line were utilized to
                calculate the vertical divergence between lines caused by vertical GPS drift.
                Automated Z calibration was the final step employed for relative accuracy

      <verticalAccuracy>
        <accuracyReport>The vertical accuracy of the LiDAR data is described as the mean and standard
                deviation (sigma ~ Ï) of divergence of LiDAR point coordinates from RTK ground
                survey point coordinates. To provide a sense of the model predictive power of the
                dataset, the root mean square error (RMSE) for vertical accuracy is also provided.
                These statistics assume the error distributions for x, y, and z are normally
                distributed, thus we also consider the skew and kurtosis of distributions when
                evaluating error statistics. Statements of statistical accuracy apply to fixed
                terrestrial surfaces only and may not be applied to areas of dense vegetation or
                steep terrain. Additional control points are needed to assess accuracy in different

      <entityDescription>Standard deviation of height is derived from the raw Lidar point clouds using the FUSION software. The horizontal resolution is 5 meters. Only first Lidar returns were used so that height metrics describe the top of the canopy. This metric measures the standard deviation of height of first return Lidar points in a given grid cell. Only Lidar points greater than 1 meter off the ground were used in this analysis.Watershed Sciences, Inc. (WS) collected Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data from HJ Andrews and the Willamette National Forest (NF) on August 10th and 11th 2008. Total area for this AOI is 17,705 acres.

            <para>Simultaneous with the airborne data collection mission, we conducted
                    multiple static (1 Hz recording frequency) ground surveys over monuments with
                    known coordinates (Table 1). Indexed by time, these GPS data are used to correct
                    the continuous onboard measurements of aircraft position recorded throughout the
                    mission. Multiple sessions were processed over the same monument to confirm

                    survey, these static GPS data were then processed using triangulation with
                    Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) stations, and checked against
                    the Online Positioning User Service (OPUS2) to quantify daily variance. Controls

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on
                    independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft
                    trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned
                    an associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255).
                    The data were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the
                    corresponding scan angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting,
                    northing, and elevation) information. These initial laser point files were too
                    large for subsequent processing. To facilitate laser point processing, bins
                    (polygons) were created to divide the dataset into manageable sizes (&lt; 500
                    MB). Flightlines and LiDAR data were then reviewed to ensure complete coverage
                    of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. Laser point data
                    were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and manual calibration was
                    performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale
                    (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed Sciences,
                    each of these offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points were
                    then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
                    well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits,
                    isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected
                    for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin
                    containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are
                    typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of
                    non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc.
                    Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines
                    were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system
                    misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor
                    attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative
                    accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                    resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (&lt;1 cm)
                    in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed specifically for
                    classifying near-ground points (Soininen, 2004). The processing sequence began
                    by âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the earth based on geometric
                    constraints used to evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare earth
                    (ground) model was visually inspected and additional ground point modeling was
                    performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This manual editing
                    of grounds often occurs in areas with known ground modeling deficiencies, such
                    as: bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream banks, and dense vegetation.
                    In some cases, automated ground point classification erroneously included known
                    vegetation (i.e., understory, low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were
                    manually reclassified as non-grounds. Ground surface rasters were developed from
                    triangulated irregular networks (TINs) of ground points.</para>

            <para>The LiDAR survey uses a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. For the HJ
                    Andrews and Willamette NF study areas, the sensor scan angle was Â±14o from
                    nadir1 with a pulse rate designed to yield an average native density (number of
                    pulses emitted by the laser system) of 8 points per square meter over
                    terrestrial surfaces. All study areas were surveyed with an opposing flight line
                    side-lap of =50% (=100% overlap) to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface
                    laser painting. The Leica ALS50 Phase II system allows up to four range
                    measurements (returns) per pulse, and all discernable laser returns were
                    processed for the output dataset. It is not uncommon for some types of surfaces
                    (e.g. dense vegetation or water) to return fewer pulses than the laser
                    originally emitted. These discrepancies between ânativeâ and âdeliveredâ density
                    will vary depending on terrain, land cover and the prevalence of water bodies.
                    To accurately solve for laser point position (geographic coordinates x, y, z),
                    the positional coordinates of the airborne sensor and the attitude of the
                    aircraft were recorded continuously throughout the LiDAR data collection
                    mission. Aircraft position was measured twice per second (2 Hz) by an onboard
                    differential GPS unit. Aircraft attitude was measured 200 times per second (200
                    Hz) as pitch, roll and yaw (heading) from an onboard inertial measurement unit
                    (IMU). To allow for post-processing correction and calibration, aircraft/sensor
                    position and attitude data are indexed by GPS time</para>

Also, a bare earth DTM was created from the Watershed Sciences 1m Bare Earth raster. This is used to normalize the Lidar points to height above ground so the height thresholds can be assessed. The GRIDMETRICS command was run with a python script (runFusion_height3.py). The Lidar data were tiled into pieces small enough to process and then clipped back to remove erronious edges.

                process the kinematic corrections for the aircraft. The static and kinematic GPS
                data were then post-processed after the survey to obtain an accurate GPS solution
                and aircraft positions. POSPAC was used to develop a trajectory file that includes
                corrected aircraft position and attitude information. The trajectory data for the
                entire flight survey session were incorporated into a final smoothed best estimated
                trajectory (SBET) file that contains accurate and continuous aircraft positions and
                attitudes.</accuracyReport>

          <quantitativeAccuracyMethod>Manual System Calibration: Calibration procedures for each mission require
                solving geometric relationships that relate measured swath-to-swath deviations to
                misalignments of system attitude parameters. Corrected scale, pitch, roll and
                heading offsets were calculated and applied to resolve misalignments. The raw
                divergence between lines was computed after the manual calibration was completed and
                reported for each study area. 2. Automated Attitude Calibration: All data were
                tested and calibrated using TerraMatch automated sampling routines. Ground points
                were classified for each individual flight line and used for line-to-line testing.
                System misalignment offsets (pitch, roll and heading) and scale were solved for each
                individual mission and applied to respective mission datasets. The data from each
                mission were then blended when imported together to form the entire area of

                calculate the vertical divergence between lines caused by vertical GPS drift.

            <para>Simultaneous with the airborne data collection mission, we conducted
                    multiple static (1 Hz recording frequency) ground surveys over monuments with

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on
                    independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft
                    trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned
                    an associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255).
                    The data were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the
                    corresponding scan angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting,
                    northing, and elevation) information. These initial laser point files were too
                    large for subsequent processing. To facilitate laser point processing, bins
                    (polygons) were created to divide the dataset into manageable sizes (&lt; 500
                    MB). Flightlines and LiDAR data were then reviewed to ensure complete coverage
                    of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. Laser point data
                    were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and manual calibration was
                    performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale
                    (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed Sciences,
                    each of these offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points were
                    then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
                    well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits,
                    isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected
                    for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin
                    containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are
                    typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of
                    non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc.
                    Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines
                    were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system
                    misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor
                    attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative
                    accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                    resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (&lt;1 cm)
                    in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed specifically for
                    classifying near-ground points (Soininen, 2004). The processing sequence began
                    by âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the earth based on geometric
                    constraints used to evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare earth
                    (ground) model was visually inspected and additional ground point modeling was
                    performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This manual editing
                    of grounds often occurs in areas with known ground modeling deficiencies, such
                    as: bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream banks, and dense vegetation.
                    In some cases, automated ground point classification erroneously included known
                    vegetation (i.e., understory, low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were
                    manually reclassified as non-grounds. Ground surface rasters were developed from
                    triangulated irregular networks (TINs) of ground points.</para>

            <para>The LiDAR survey uses a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. For the HJ
                    Andrews and Willamette NF study areas, the sensor scan angle was Â±14o from
                    nadir1 with a pulse rate designed to yield an average native density (number of
                    pulses emitted by the laser system) of 8 points per square meter over
                    terrestrial surfaces. All study areas were surveyed with an opposing flight line
                    side-lap of =50% (=100% overlap) to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface
                    laser painting. The Leica ALS50 Phase II system allows up to four range
                    measurements (returns) per pulse, and all discernable laser returns were
                    processed for the output dataset. It is not uncommon for some types of surfaces
                    (e.g. dense vegetation or water) to return fewer pulses than the laser
                    originally emitted. These discrepancies between ânativeâ and âdeliveredâ density
                    will vary depending on terrain, land cover and the prevalence of water bodies.
                    To accurately solve for laser point position (geographic coordinates x, y, z),
                    the positional coordinates of the airborne sensor and the attitude of the

                    differential GPS unit. Aircraft attitude was measured 200 times per second (200
                    Hz) as pitch, roll and yaw (heading) from an onboard inertial measurement unit
                    (IMU). To allow for post-processing correction and calibration, aircraft/sensor
                    position and attitude data are indexed by GPS time</para>

      <entityDescription>The standard deviation of height was created with a focal statistics command. A 7x7 pixel focal window was used to assess standard deviation. The focal window was run on 95th percentile height. Percentile height is derived from the raw Lidar point clouds using the FUSION software. The horizontal resolution is 5 meters. Only first Lidar returns were used so that height metrics describe the top of the canopy. This metric measures the height at which 95% of the first return points are below. Watershed Sciences, Inc. (WS) collected Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data from HJ Andrews and the Willamette National Forest (NF) on August 10th and 11th 2008. Total area for this AOI is 17,705 acres. The total area of delivered LiDAR including 100 m buffer is 19,493 acres.</entityDescription>

            <para>Simultaneous with the airborne data collection mission, we conducted
                    multiple static (1 Hz recording frequency) ground surveys over monuments with
                    known coordinates (Table 1). Indexed by time, these GPS data are used to correct

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on
                    independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft
                    trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned
                    an associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255).
                    The data were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the
                    corresponding scan angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting,
                    northing, and elevation) information. These initial laser point files were too
                    large for subsequent processing. To facilitate laser point processing, bins
                    (polygons) were created to divide the dataset into manageable sizes (&lt; 500
                    MB). Flightlines and LiDAR data were then reviewed to ensure complete coverage
                    of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. Laser point data
                    were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and manual calibration was
                    performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale
                    (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed Sciences,
                    each of these offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points were
                    then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
                    well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits,
                    isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected
                    for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin
                    containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are
                    typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of
                    non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc.
                    Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines
                    were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system
                    misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor
                    attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative
                    accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                    resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (&lt;1 cm)
                    in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed specifically for
                    classifying near-ground points (Soininen, 2004). The processing sequence began
                    by âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the earth based on geometric
                    constraints used to evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare earth
                    (ground) model was visually inspected and additional ground point modeling was
                    performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This manual editing
                    of grounds often occurs in areas with known ground modeling deficiencies, such
                    as: bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream banks, and dense vegetation.
                    In some cases, automated ground point classification erroneously included known
                    vegetation (i.e., understory, low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were
                    manually reclassified as non-grounds. Ground surface rasters were developed from
                    triangulated irregular networks (TINs) of ground points.</para>

            <para>The LiDAR survey uses a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. For the HJ
                    Andrews and Willamette NF study areas, the sensor scan angle was Â±14o from
                    nadir1 with a pulse rate designed to yield an average native density (number of
                    pulses emitted by the laser system) of 8 points per square meter over
                    terrestrial surfaces. All study areas were surveyed with an opposing flight line
                    side-lap of =50% (=100% overlap) to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface
                    laser painting. The Leica ALS50 Phase II system allows up to four range
                    measurements (returns) per pulse, and all discernable laser returns were
                    processed for the output dataset. It is not uncommon for some types of surfaces
                    (e.g. dense vegetation or water) to return fewer pulses than the laser
                    originally emitted. These discrepancies between ânativeâ and âdeliveredâ density
                    will vary depending on terrain, land cover and the prevalence of water bodies.
                    To accurately solve for laser point position (geographic coordinates x, y, z),
                    the positional coordinates of the airborne sensor and the attitude of the
                    aircraft were recorded continuously throughout the LiDAR data collection
                    mission. Aircraft position was measured twice per second (2 Hz) by an onboard
                    differential GPS unit. Aircraft attitude was measured 200 times per second (200
                    Hz) as pitch, roll and yaw (heading) from an onboard inertial measurement unit
                    (IMU). To allow for post-processing correction and calibration, aircraft/sensor
                    position and attitude data are indexed by GPS time</para>

The GRIDMETRICS command was run with a python script (runFusion_height3.py). The Lidar data were tiled into pieces small enough to process and then clipped back to remove erronious edges.

                    mission. Multiple sessions were processed over the same monument to confirm
                    antenna height measurements and reported position accuracy. After the airborne
                    survey, these static GPS data were then processed using triangulation with
                    Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) stations, and checked against
                    the Online Positioning User Service (OPUS2) to quantify daily variance. Controls
                    were located within 13 nautical miles of the mission area(s).</para>

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on
                    independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft
                    trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned
                    an associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255).
                    The data were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the
                    corresponding scan angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting,
                    northing, and elevation) information. These initial laser point files were too
                    large for subsequent processing. To facilitate laser point processing, bins
                    (polygons) were created to divide the dataset into manageable sizes (&lt; 500
                    MB). Flightlines and LiDAR data were then reviewed to ensure complete coverage
                    of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. Laser point data
                    were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and manual calibration was
                    performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale
                    (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed Sciences,
                    each of these offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points were
                    then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
                    well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits,
                    isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected
                    for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin
                    containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are
                    typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of
                    non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc.
                    Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines
                    were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system
                    misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor
                    attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative
                    accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                    resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (&lt;1 cm)
                    in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed specifically for
                    classifying near-ground points (Soininen, 2004). The processing sequence began
                    by âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the earth based on geometric
                    constraints used to evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare earth
                    (ground) model was visually inspected and additional ground point modeling was
                    performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This manual editing
                    of grounds often occurs in areas with known ground modeling deficiencies, such
                    as: bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream banks, and dense vegetation.
                    In some cases, automated ground point classification erroneously included known
                    vegetation (i.e., understory, low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were
                    manually reclassified as non-grounds. Ground surface rasters were developed from
                    triangulated irregular networks (TINs) of ground points.</para>

            <para>The LiDAR survey uses a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. For the HJ
                    Andrews and Willamette NF study areas, the sensor scan angle was Â±14o from
                    nadir1 with a pulse rate designed to yield an average native density (number of
                    pulses emitted by the laser system) of 8 points per square meter over
                    terrestrial surfaces. All study areas were surveyed with an opposing flight line
                    side-lap of =50% (=100% overlap) to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface
                    laser painting. The Leica ALS50 Phase II system allows up to four range
                    measurements (returns) per pulse, and all discernable laser returns were
                    processed for the output dataset. It is not uncommon for some types of surfaces
                    (e.g. dense vegetation or water) to return fewer pulses than the laser
                    originally emitted. These discrepancies between ânativeâ and âdeliveredâ density
                    will vary depending on terrain, land cover and the prevalence of water bodies.
                    To accurately solve for laser point position (geographic coordinates x, y, z),
                    the positional coordinates of the airborne sensor and the attitude of the
                    aircraft were recorded continuously throughout the LiDAR data collection
                    mission. Aircraft position was measured twice per second (2 Hz) by an onboard
                    differential GPS unit. Aircraft attitude was measured 200 times per second (200
                    Hz) as pitch, roll and yaw (heading) from an onboard inertial measurement unit
                    (IMU). To allow for post-processing correction and calibration, aircraft/sensor
                    position and attitude data are indexed by GPS time</para>

            <para>Using the 0.5m canopy model, some window thresholds between 3 and 23 meters, and a tree height to crown radii relationship the TreeVaW software was used to generate the stem maps. The height to crown radii relationship for 10-60m trees was created from equations in the literature. The 60m and taller trees were not found in the literature so I ran the TreeVaW software to create tree stem greater than 60m. I then used these points to create a relationship which I fed back info TreeVaW for trees greater than 60m.

        <accuracyReport>LiDAR survey datasets were referenced to the 1 Hz static ground GPS data
                collected over presurveyed monuments with known coordinates. While surveying, the
                aircraft collected 2 Hz kinematic GPS data, and the onboard inertial measurement
                unit (IMU) collected 200 Hz aircraft attitude data. Realm Survey Suite was used to
                process the kinematic corrections for the aircraft. The static and kinematic GPS
                data were then post-processed after the survey to obtain an accurate GPS solution
                and aircraft positions. POSPAC was used to develop a trajectory file that includes
                corrected aircraft position and attitude information. The trajectory data for the
                entire flight survey session were incorporated into a final smoothed best estimated
                trajectory (SBET) file that contains accurate and continuous aircraft positions and
                attitudes.</accuracyReport>

          <quantitativeAccuracyMethod>Manual System Calibration: Calibration procedures for each mission require
                solving geometric relationships that relate measured swath-to-swath deviations to
                misalignments of system attitude parameters. Corrected scale, pitch, roll and
                heading offsets were calculated and applied to resolve misalignments. The raw
                divergence between lines was computed after the manual calibration was completed and
                reported for each study area. 2. Automated Attitude Calibration: All data were
                tested and calibrated using TerraMatch automated sampling routines. Ground points
                were classified for each individual flight line and used for line-to-line testing.
                System misalignment offsets (pitch, roll and heading) and scale were solved for each
                individual mission and applied to respective mission datasets. The data from each
                mission were then blended when imported together to form the entire area of
                interest. 3. Automated Z Calibration: Ground points per line were utilized to
                calculate the vertical divergence between lines caused by vertical GPS drift.
                Automated Z calibration was the final step employed for relative accuracy
                calibration.</quantitativeAccuracyMethod>

      <verticalAccuracy>
        <accuracyReport>The vertical accuracy of the LiDAR data is described as the mean and standard
                deviation (sigma ~ Ï) of divergence of LiDAR point coordinates from RTK ground
                survey point coordinates. To provide a sense of the model predictive power of the
                dataset, the root mean square error (RMSE) for vertical accuracy is also provided.
                These statistics assume the error distributions for x, y, and z are normally
                distributed, thus we also consider the skew and kurtosis of distributions when
                evaluating error statistics. Statements of statistical accuracy apply to fixed
                terrestrial surfaces only and may not be applied to areas of dense vegetation or
                steep terrain. Additional control points are needed to assess accuracy in different
                land covers</accuracyReport>
