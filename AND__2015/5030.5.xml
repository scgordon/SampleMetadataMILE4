    <abstract>
      <para>Watershed Sciences, Inc. collected Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data from HJ Andrews and the Willamette National Forest (WNF) on August 10-11, 2008. Total area of the study are  is 17,705 acres. The total area of delivered LiDAR including 100 m buffer is 19,493 acres. This data set includes the base products delivered by Watershed Sciences, and derived products (hill shades, slope and aspect grids, and contours). The base products include the point cloud data (LAS format), and the derived bare-earth and highest-hits digital elevation models (DEM).  The DEMs are at 1 meter cell size resolution.  The bare-earth DEM is a representation of the topography of the area, with all the vegetation removed.  The highest-hit DEM is a representation of the first object the LiDAR system struck during data capture.  This includes the bare-earth topography with vegetation and structures.  The vegetation DEM is the result of subtracting the bare-earth DEM from the highest-hit DEM.  The elevations are the heights of the vegetation. The final products are in ESRI GRID digital format, with a 1 meter cell size resolution. Each cell in the GRID has a value that represents the modeled elevation (either total elevation or vegetation height) at that location. The resulting DEM's were used to create slope, aspect, hill shade, and contour data for the area.</para>

          <para>2.1 Airborne Survey â Instrumentation and Methods</para>
          <para>The LiDAR survey uses a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. For the HJ Andrews and Willamette NF study areas, the sensor scan angle was Â±14o from nadir1 with a pulse rate designed to yield an average native density (number of pulses emitted by the laser system) of (Nadir refers to the perpendicular vector to the ground directly below the aircraft. Nadir is commonly used to measure the angle from the vector and is referred to a âdegrees from nadirâ.) 8 points per square meter over terrestrial surfaces. All study areas were surveyed with an opposing flight line side-lap of =50% (=100% overlap) to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface laser painting. The Leica ALS50 Phase II system allows up to four range measurements (returns) per pulse, and all discernable laser returns were processed for the output dataset.
It is not uncommon for some types of surfaces (e.g. dense vegetation or water) to return fewer pulses than the laser originally emitted. These discrepancies between ânativeâ and âdeliveredâ density will vary depending on terrain, land cover and the prevalence of water bodies.</para>
          <para>To accurately solve for laser point position (geographic coordinates x, y, z), the positional coordinates of the airborne sensor and the attitude of the aircraft were recorded continuously throughout the LiDAR data collection mission. Aircraft position was measured twice per second (2 Hz) by an onboard differential GPS unit. Aircraft attitude was measured 200 times
per second (200 Hz) as pitch, roll and yaw (heading) from an onboard inertial measurement unit (IMU). To allow for post-processing correction and calibration, aircraft/sensor position and attitude data are indexed by GPS time.</para>

          <para>Simultaneous with the airborne data collection mission, we conducted multiple static (1 Hz recording frequency) ground surveys over monuments with known coordinates (Table 1). Indexed by time, these GPS data are used to correct the continuous onboard measurements of aircraft position recorded throughout the mission. Multiple sessions were processed over the same monument to confirm antenna height measurements and reported position accuracy.</para>
          <para>After the airborne survey, these static GPS data were then processed using triangulation with Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) stations, and checked against the Online Positioning User Service (OPUS2) to quantify daily variance. Controls were located within 13 nautical miles of the mission area(s).</para>

          <para>Aircraft Kinematic GPS and IMU Data
LiDAR survey datasets were referenced to the 1 Hz static ground GPS data collected over presurveyed monuments with known coordinates. While surveying, the aircraft collected 2 Hz kinematic GPS data, and the onboard inertial measurement unit (IMU) collected 200 Hz aircraft attitude data. Realm Survey Suite was used to process the kinematic corrections for the aircraft. The static and kinematic GPS data were then post-processed after the survey to obtain an accurate GPS solution and aircraft positions. POSPAC was used to develop a trajectory file that includes corrected aircraft position and attitude information. The trajectory data for the entire flight survey session were incorporated into a final smoothed best estimated trajectory (SBET) file that contains accurate and continuous aircraft positions and attitudes.</para>

          <para>Laser Point Processing
Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned an associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255). The data were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the corresponding scan angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting, northing, and elevation) information.

Laser point data were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and manual calibration was performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed Sciences, each of these offsets was resolved
and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points were then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits, isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc. Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (less than 1 cm) in relative accuracy.</para>

            <para>Simultaneous with the airborne data collection mission, we conducted multiple
              static (1 Hz recording frequency) ground surveys over monuments with known coordinates
              (Table 1). Indexed by time, these GPS data are used to correct the continuous onboard
              measurements of aircraft position recorded throughout the mission. Multiple sessions
              were processed over the same monument to confirm antenna height measurements and
              reported position accuracy. After the airborne survey, these static GPS data were then
              processed using triangulation with Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS)
              stations, and checked against the Online Positioning User Service (OPUS2) to quantify
              daily variance. Controls were located within 13 nautical miles of the mission
              area(s).</para>

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on
              independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft
              trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned an
              associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255). The data
              were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the corresponding scan
              angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting, northing, and elevation)
              information. These initial laser point files were too large for subsequent processing.
              To facilitate laser point processing, bins (polygons) were created to divide the
              dataset into manageable sizes (&lt; 500 MB). Flightlines and LiDAR data were then
              reviewed to ensure complete coverage of the study area and positional accuracy of the
              laser points. Laser point data were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and
              manual calibration was performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading
              and scale (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed
              Sciences, each of these offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points
              were then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
              well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits, isolated
              points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected for remaining
              pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin containing approximately
              7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are typically found to be
              artificially low or high. Common sources of non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds,
              vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc. Internal calibration was refined using
              TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines were tested for internal consistency and
              final adjustments were made for system misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading
              offsets and scale). Automated sensor attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm
              improvements in the relative accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected,
              vertical GPS drift was then resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight
              improvement (&lt;1 cm) in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed
              specifically for classifying near-ground points (Soininen, 2004). The processing
              sequence began by âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the earth based on
              geometric constraints used to evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare earth
              (ground) model was visually inspected and additional ground point modeling was
              performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This manual editing of
              grounds often occurs in areas with known ground modeling deficiencies, such as:
              bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream banks, and dense vegetation. In some
              cases, automated ground point classification erroneously included known vegetation
              (i.e., understory, low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were manually reclassified as
              non-grounds. Ground surface rasters were developed from triangulated irregular
              networks (TINs) of ground points.</para>

            <para>The LiDAR survey uses a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. For the HJ Andrews and
              Willamette NF study areas, the sensor scan angle was Â±14o from nadir1 with a pulse
              rate designed to yield an average native density (number of pulses emitted by the
              laser system) of 8 points per square meter over terrestrial surfaces. All study areas
              were surveyed with an opposing flight line side-lap of =50% (=100% overlap) to reduce
              laser shadowing and increase surface laser painting. The Leica ALS50 Phase II system
              allows up to four range measurements (returns) per pulse, and all discernable laser
              returns were processed for the output dataset. It is not uncommon for some types of
              surfaces (e.g. dense vegetation or water) to return fewer pulses than the laser
              originally emitted. These discrepancies between ânativeâ and âdeliveredâ density will
              vary depending on terrain, land cover and the prevalence of water bodies. To
              accurately solve for laser point position (geographic coordinates x, y, z), the
              positional coordinates of the airborne sensor and the attitude of the aircraft were
              recorded continuously throughout the LiDAR data collection mission. Aircraft position
              was measured twice per second (2 Hz) by an onboard differential GPS unit. Aircraft
              attitude was measured 200 times per second (200 Hz) as pitch, roll and yaw (heading)
              from an onboard inertial measurement unit (IMU). To allow for post-processing
              correction and calibration, aircraft/sensor position and attitude data are indexed by
              GPS time</para>

        <accuracyReport>LiDAR survey datasets were referenced to the 1 Hz static ground GPS data
                collected over presurveyed monuments with known coordinates. While surveying, the
                aircraft collected 2 Hz kinematic GPS data, and the onboard inertial measurement
                unit (IMU) collected 200 Hz aircraft attitude data. Realm Survey Suite was used to
                process the kinematic corrections for the aircraft. The static and kinematic GPS
                data were then post-processed after the survey to obtain an accurate GPS solution
                and aircraft positions. POSPAC was used to develop a trajectory file that includes
                corrected aircraft position and attitude information. The trajectory data for the

          <quantitativeAccuracyMethod>Manual System Calibration: Calibration procedures for each mission require
                solving geometric relationships that relate measured swath-to-swath deviations to

                heading offsets were calculated and applied to resolve misalignments. The raw
                divergence between lines was computed after the manual calibration was completed and
                reported for each study area. 2. Automated Attitude Calibration: All data were
                tested and calibrated using TerraMatch automated sampling routines. Ground points
                were classified for each individual flight line and used for line-to-line testing.
                System misalignment offsets (pitch, roll and heading) and scale were solved for each
                individual mission and applied to respective mission datasets. The data from each
                mission were then blended when imported together to form the entire area of
                interest. 3. Automated Z Calibration: Ground points per line were utilized to
                calculate the vertical divergence between lines caused by vertical GPS drift.
                Automated Z calibration was the final step employed for relative accuracy

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on
                    independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft
                    trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned
                    an associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255).
                    The data were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the
                    corresponding scan angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting,
                    northing, and elevation) information. These initial laser point files were too
                    large for subsequent processing. To facilitate laser point processing, bins
                    (polygons) were created to divide the dataset into manageable sizes (&lt; 500
                    MB). Flightlines and LiDAR data were then reviewed to ensure complete coverage
                    of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. Laser point data
                    were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and manual calibration was
                    performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale
                    (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed Sciences,
                    each of these offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points were
                    then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
                    well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits,
                    isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected
                    for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin
                    containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are
                    typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of
                    non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc.
                    Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines
                    were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system
                    misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor
                    attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative
                    accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                    resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (&lt;1 cm)
                    in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed specifically for
                    classifying near-ground points (Soininen, 2004). The processing sequence began
                    by âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the earth based on geometric
                    constraints used to evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare earth
                    (ground) model was visually inspected and additional ground point modeling was
                    performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This manual editing
                    of grounds often occurs in areas with known ground modeling deficiencies, such
                    as: bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream banks, and dense vegetation.
                    In some cases, automated ground point classification erroneously included known
                    vegetation (i.e., understory, low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were
                    manually reclassified as non-grounds. Ground surface rasters were developed from
                    triangulated irregular networks (TINs) of ground points.</para>

            <para>The LiDAR survey uses a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. For the HJ
                    Andrews and Willamette NF study areas, the sensor scan angle was Â±14o from
                    nadir1 with a pulse rate designed to yield an average native density (number of
                    pulses emitted by the laser system) of 8 points per square meter over
                    terrestrial surfaces. All study areas were surveyed with an opposing flight line
                    side-lap of =50% (=100% overlap) to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface
                    laser painting. The Leica ALS50 Phase II system allows up to four range
                    measurements (returns) per pulse, and all discernable laser returns were
                    processed for the output dataset. It is not uncommon for some types of surfaces
                    (e.g. dense vegetation or water) to return fewer pulses than the laser
                    originally emitted. These discrepancies between ânativeâ and âdeliveredâ density
                    will vary depending on terrain, land cover and the prevalence of water bodies.
                    To accurately solve for laser point position (geographic coordinates x, y, z),
                    the positional coordinates of the airborne sensor and the attitude of the
                    aircraft were recorded continuously throughout the LiDAR data collection
                    mission. Aircraft position was measured twice per second (2 Hz) by an onboard
                    differential GPS unit. Aircraft attitude was measured 200 times per second (200
                    Hz) as pitch, roll and yaw (heading) from an onboard inertial measurement unit
                    (IMU). To allow for post-processing correction and calibration, aircraft/sensor
                    position and attitude data are indexed by GPS time</para>

                    isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected
                    for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin
                    containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are
                    typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of
                    non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc.
                    Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines
                    were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system
                    misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor
                    attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative
                    accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                    resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (&lt;1 cm)
                    in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed specifically for
                    classifying near-ground points (Soininen, 2004). The processing sequence began
                    by âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the earth based on geometric
                    constraints used to evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare earth
                    (ground) model was visually inspected and additional ground point modeling was
                    performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This manual editing
                    of grounds often occurs in areas with known ground modeling deficiencies, such
                    as: bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream banks, and dense vegetation.
                    In some cases, automated ground point classification erroneously included known
                    vegetation (i.e., understory, low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were
                    manually reclassified as non-grounds. Ground surface rasters were developed from
                    triangulated irregular networks (TINs) of ground points.</para>

            <para>The LiDAR survey uses a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. For the HJ
                    Andrews and Willamette NF study areas, the sensor scan angle was Â±14o from
                    nadir1 with a pulse rate designed to yield an average native density (number of
                    pulses emitted by the laser system) of 8 points per square meter over
                    terrestrial surfaces. All study areas were surveyed with an opposing flight line
                    side-lap of =50% (=100% overlap) to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface
                    laser painting. The Leica ALS50 Phase II system allows up to four range
                    measurements (returns) per pulse, and all discernable laser returns were
                    processed for the output dataset. It is not uncommon for some types of surfaces
                    (e.g. dense vegetation or water) to return fewer pulses than the laser
                    originally emitted. These discrepancies between ânativeâ and âdeliveredâ density
                    will vary depending on terrain, land cover and the prevalence of water bodies.

                    mission. Aircraft position was measured twice per second (2 Hz) by an onboard
                    differential GPS unit. Aircraft attitude was measured 200 times per second (200
                    Hz) as pitch, roll and yaw (heading) from an onboard inertial measurement unit
                    (IMU). To allow for post-processing correction and calibration, aircraft/sensor

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on
                    independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft
                    trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned
                    an associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255).
                    The data were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the
                    corresponding scan angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting,
                    northing, and elevation) information. These initial laser point files were too
                    large for subsequent processing. To facilitate laser point processing, bins
                    (polygons) were created to divide the dataset into manageable sizes (&lt; 500
                    MB). Flightlines and LiDAR data were then reviewed to ensure complete coverage
                    of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. Laser point data
                    were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and manual calibration was
                    performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale
                    (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed Sciences,
                    each of these offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points were
                    then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
                    well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits,
                    isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected
                    for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin
                    containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are
                    typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of
                    non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc.
                    Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines
                    were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system
                    misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor
                    attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative
                    accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                    resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (&lt;1 cm)
                    in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed specifically for

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on
                    independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft
                    trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned
                    an associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255).
                    The data were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the
                    corresponding scan angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting,
                    northing, and elevation) information. These initial laser point files were too
                    large for subsequent processing. To facilitate laser point processing, bins
                    (polygons) were created to divide the dataset into manageable sizes (&lt; 500
                    MB). Flightlines and LiDAR data were then reviewed to ensure complete coverage
                    of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. Laser point data
                    were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and manual calibration was
                    performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale
                    (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed Sciences,
                    each of these offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points were
                    then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
                    well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits,
                    isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected
                    for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin
                    containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are
                    typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of
                    non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc.
                    Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines
                    were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system
                    misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor
                    attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative
                    accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                    resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (&lt;1 cm)
                    in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed specifically for
                    classifying near-ground points (Soininen, 2004). The processing sequence began
                    by âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the earth based on geometric
                    constraints used to evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare earth
                    (ground) model was visually inspected and additional ground point modeling was
                    performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This manual editing
                    of grounds often occurs in areas with known ground modeling deficiencies, such
                    as: bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream banks, and dense vegetation.
                    In some cases, automated ground point classification erroneously included known
                    vegetation (i.e., understory, low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were
                    manually reclassified as non-grounds. Ground surface rasters were developed from
                    triangulated irregular networks (TINs) of ground points.</para>

            <para>The LiDAR survey uses a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. For the HJ
                    Andrews and Willamette NF study areas, the sensor scan angle was Â±14o from
                    nadir1 with a pulse rate designed to yield an average native density (number of
                    pulses emitted by the laser system) of 8 points per square meter over
                    terrestrial surfaces. All study areas were surveyed with an opposing flight line
                    side-lap of =50% (=100% overlap) to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface
                    laser painting. The Leica ALS50 Phase II system allows up to four range
                    measurements (returns) per pulse, and all discernable laser returns were
                    processed for the output dataset. It is not uncommon for some types of surfaces
                    (e.g. dense vegetation or water) to return fewer pulses than the laser
                    originally emitted. These discrepancies between ânativeâ and âdeliveredâ density
                    will vary depending on terrain, land cover and the prevalence of water bodies.

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on
                        independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft
                        trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned
                        an associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255).
                        The data were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the
                        corresponding scan angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting,
                        northing, and elevation) information. These initial laser point files were too
                        large for subsequent processing. To facilitate laser point processing, bins
                        (polygons) were created to divide the dataset into manageable sizes (&lt; 500
                        MB). Flightlines and LiDAR data were then reviewed to ensure complete coverage
                        of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. Laser point data
                        were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and manual calibration was
                        performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale
                        (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed Sciences,
                        each of these offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points were
                        then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
                        well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits,
                        isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected
                        for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin
                        containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are
                        typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of
                        non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc.
                        Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines
                        were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system
                        misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor
                        attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative
                        accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                        resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (&lt;1 cm)
                        in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed specifically for
                        classifying near-ground points (Soininen, 2004). The processing sequence began
                        by âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the earth based on geometric
                        constraints used to evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare earth
                        (ground) model was visually inspected and additional ground point modeling was
                        performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This manual editing
                        of grounds often occurs in areas with known ground modeling deficiencies, such
                        as: bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream banks, and dense vegetation.
                        In some cases, automated ground point classification erroneously included known
                        vegetation (i.e., understory, low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were
                        manually reclassified as non-grounds. Ground surface rasters were developed from
                        triangulated irregular networks (TINs) of ground points.</para>

            <para>The LiDAR survey uses a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. For the HJ
                        Andrews and Willamette NF study areas, the sensor scan angle was Â±14o from
                        nadir1 with a pulse rate designed to yield an average native density (number of
                        pulses emitted by the laser system) of 8 points per square meter over
                        terrestrial surfaces. All study areas were surveyed with an opposing flight line
                        side-lap of =50% (=100% overlap) to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface
                        laser painting. The Leica ALS50 Phase II system allows up to four range
                        measurements (returns) per pulse, and all discernable laser returns were
                        processed for the output dataset. It is not uncommon for some types of surfaces
                        (e.g. dense vegetation or water) to return fewer pulses than the laser
                        originally emitted. These discrepancies between ânativeâ and âdeliveredâ density
                        will vary depending on terrain, land cover and the prevalence of water bodies.
                        To accurately solve for laser point position (geographic coordinates x, y, z),
                        the positional coordinates of the airborne sensor and the attitude of the
                        aircraft were recorded continuously throughout the LiDAR data collection
                        mission. Aircraft position was measured twice per second (2 Hz) by an onboard
                        differential GPS unit. Aircraft attitude was measured 200 times per second (200
                        Hz) as pitch, roll and yaw (heading) from an onboard inertial measurement unit
                        (IMU). To allow for post-processing correction and calibration, aircraft/sensor
                        position and attitude data are indexed by GPS time</para>

            <para>Simultaneous with the airborne data collection mission, we conducted
                        multiple static (1 Hz recording frequency) ground surveys over monuments with
                        known coordinates (Table 1). Indexed by time, these GPS data are used to correct
                        the continuous onboard measurements of aircraft position recorded throughout the
                        mission. Multiple sessions were processed over the same monument to confirm
                        antenna height measurements and reported position accuracy. After the airborne
                        survey, these static GPS data were then processed using triangulation with
                        Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) stations, and checked against
                        the Online Positioning User Service (OPUS2) to quantify daily variance. Controls

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on
                        independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft
                        trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned
                        an associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255).
                        The data were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the
                        corresponding scan angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting,
                        northing, and elevation) information. These initial laser point files were too
                        large for subsequent processing. To facilitate laser point processing, bins
                        (polygons) were created to divide the dataset into manageable sizes (&lt; 500
                        MB). Flightlines and LiDAR data were then reviewed to ensure complete coverage
                        of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. Laser point data
                        were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and manual calibration was
                        performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale
                        (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed Sciences,
                        each of these offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points were
                        then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
                        well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits,
                        isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected
                        for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin
                        containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are
                        typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of
                        non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc.
                        Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines
                        were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system
                        misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor
                        attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative
                        accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                        resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (&lt;1 cm)
                        in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed specifically for
                        classifying near-ground points (Soininen, 2004). The processing sequence began
                        by âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the earth based on geometric
                        constraints used to evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare earth
                        (ground) model was visually inspected and additional ground point modeling was
                        performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This manual editing
                        of grounds often occurs in areas with known ground modeling deficiencies, such
                        as: bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream banks, and dense vegetation.
                        In some cases, automated ground point classification erroneously included known
                        vegetation (i.e., understory, low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were
                        manually reclassified as non-grounds. Ground surface rasters were developed from
                        triangulated irregular networks (TINs) of ground points.</para>

            <para>The LiDAR survey uses a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. For the HJ
                        Andrews and Willamette NF study areas, the sensor scan angle was Â±14o from
                        nadir1 with a pulse rate designed to yield an average native density (number of
                        pulses emitted by the laser system) of 8 points per square meter over
                        terrestrial surfaces. All study areas were surveyed with an opposing flight line
                        side-lap of =50% (=100% overlap) to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface
                        laser painting. The Leica ALS50 Phase II system allows up to four range
                        measurements (returns) per pulse, and all discernable laser returns were
                        processed for the output dataset. It is not uncommon for some types of surfaces
                        (e.g. dense vegetation or water) to return fewer pulses than the laser
                        originally emitted. These discrepancies between ânativeâ and âdeliveredâ density
                        will vary depending on terrain, land cover and the prevalence of water bodies.

                        the positional coordinates of the airborne sensor and the attitude of the
                        aircraft were recorded continuously throughout the LiDAR data collection
                        mission. Aircraft position was measured twice per second (2 Hz) by an onboard
                        differential GPS unit. Aircraft attitude was measured 200 times per second (200
                        Hz) as pitch, roll and yaw (heading) from an onboard inertial measurement unit
                        (IMU). To allow for post-processing correction and calibration, aircraft/sensor
                        position and attitude data are indexed by GPS time</para>

        <accuracyReport>LiDAR survey datasets were referenced to the 1 Hz static ground GPS data
                collected over presurveyed monuments with known coordinates. While surveying, the
                aircraft collected 2 Hz kinematic GPS data, and the onboard inertial measurement
                unit (IMU) collected 200 Hz aircraft attitude data. Realm Survey Suite was used to
                process the kinematic corrections for the aircraft. The static and kinematic GPS
                data were then post-processed after the survey to obtain an accurate GPS solution
                and aircraft positions. POSPAC was used to develop a trajectory file that includes
                corrected aircraft position and attitude information. The trajectory data for the
                entire flight survey session were incorporated into a final smoothed best estimated
                trajectory (SBET) file that contains accurate and continuous aircraft positions and

          <quantitativeAccuracyMethod>Manual System Calibration: Calibration procedures for each mission require
                solving geometric relationships that relate measured swath-to-swath deviations to
                misalignments of system attitude parameters. Corrected scale, pitch, roll and
                heading offsets were calculated and applied to resolve misalignments. The raw
                divergence between lines was computed after the manual calibration was completed and
                reported for each study area. 2. Automated Attitude Calibration: All data were
                tested and calibrated using TerraMatch automated sampling routines. Ground points
                were classified for each individual flight line and used for line-to-line testing.
                System misalignment offsets (pitch, roll and heading) and scale were solved for each
                individual mission and applied to respective mission datasets. The data from each
                mission were then blended when imported together to form the entire area of
                interest. 3. Automated Z Calibration: Ground points per line were utilized to
                calculate the vertical divergence between lines caused by vertical GPS drift.

        <accuracyReport>The vertical accuracy of the LiDAR data is described as the mean and standard
                deviation (sigma ~ Ï) of divergence of LiDAR point coordinates from RTK ground
