      <abstract>
        <para>The H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest is a living laboratory that provides unparalleled opportunities for the study of forest and stream ecosystems in the central Cascade Range of Oregon. Since 1980, as a part of the National Science Foundation Long Term Ecological Research (NSF-LTER) program, the Andrews Experimental Forest has become a leader in the analysis of forest and stream ecosystem dynamics.</para>
        <para>Long-term field experiments and measurement programs have focused on climate dynamics, streamflow, water quality, and vegetation succession. Currently researchers are working to develop concepts and tools needed to predict effects of natural disturbance, land use, and climate change on ecosystem structure, function, and species composition. </para>
        <para>The Andrews Experimental Forest is administered cooperatively by the USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University and the Willamette National Forest. Funding for the research program comes from the National Science Foundation (NSF), US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University, and other sources.</para>

          <descriptorValue>The Andrews Forest is situated in the western Cascade Range of Oregon, and covers the entire 15,800-acre (6400-ha) drainage basin of Lookout Creek. Elevation ranges from 1350 to 5340 feet (410 to 1630 m). Broadly representative of the rugged mountainous landscape of the Pacific Northwest, the Andrews Forest contains excellent examples of the region's conifer forests and associated wildlife and stream ecosystems. These forests are among the tallest and most productive in the world, with tree heights of often greater than 250 ft (75 m). Streams are steep, cold and clean, providing habitat for numerous aquatic organisms.</descriptorValue>

            <para>Simultaneous with the airborne data collection mission, we conducted
                    multiple static (1 Hz recording frequency) ground surveys over monuments with
                    known coordinates (Table 1). Indexed by time, these GPS data are used to correct
                    the continuous onboard measurements of aircraft position recorded throughout the
                    mission. Multiple sessions were processed over the same monument to confirm
                    antenna height measurements and reported position accuracy. After the airborne
                    survey, these static GPS data were then processed using triangulation with
                    Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) stations, and checked against
                    the Online Positioning User Service (OPUS2) to quantify daily variance. Controls
                    were located within 13 nautical miles of the mission area(s).</para>

            <para>Laser point coordinates were computed using the REALM software based on
                    independent data from the LiDAR system (pulse time, scan angle), and aircraft
                    trajectory data (SBET). Laser point returns (first through fourth) were assigned
                    an associated (x, y, z) coordinate along with unique intensity values (0-255).
                    The data were output into large LAS v. 1.1 files; each point maintains the
                    corresponding scan angle, return number (echo), intensity, and x, y, z (easting,
                    northing, and elevation) information. These initial laser point files were too
                    large for subsequent processing. To facilitate laser point processing, bins
                    (polygons) were created to divide the dataset into manageable sizes (&lt; 500
                    MB). Flightlines and LiDAR data were then reviewed to ensure complete coverage
                    of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. Laser point data
                    were imported into processing bins in TerraScan, and manual calibration was
                    performed to assess the system offsets for pitch, roll, heading and scale
                    (mirror flex). Using a geometric relationship developed by Watershed Sciences,
                    each of these offsets was resolved and corrected if necessary. LiDAR points were
                    then filtered for noise, pits (artificial low points) and birds (true birds as
                    well as erroneously high points) by screening for absolute elevation limits,
                    isolated points and height above ground. Each bin was then manually inspected
                    for remaining pits and birds and spurious points were removed. In a bin
                    containing approximately 7.5-9.0 million points, an average of 50-100 points are
                    typically found to be artificially low or high. Common sources of
                    non-terrestrial returns are clouds, birds, vapor, haze, decks, brush piles, etc.
                    Internal calibration was refined using TerraMatch. Points from overlapping lines
                    were tested for internal consistency and final adjustments were made for system
                    misalignments (i.e., pitch, roll, heading offsets and scale). Automated sensor
                    attitude and scale corrections yielded 3-5 cm improvements in the relative
                    accuracy. Once system misalignments were corrected, vertical GPS drift was then
                    resolved and removed per flight line, yielding a slight improvement (&lt;1 cm)
                    in relative accuracy. The TerraScan software suite is designed specifically for
                    classifying near-ground points (Soininen, 2004). The processing sequence began
                    by âremovingâ all points that were not ânearâ the earth based on geometric
                    constraints used to evaluate multi-return points. The resulting bare earth
                    (ground) model was visually inspected and additional ground point modeling was
                    performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. This manual editing
                    of grounds often occurs in areas with known ground modeling deficiencies, such
                    as: bedrock outcrops, cliffs, deeply incised stream banks, and dense vegetation.
                    In some cases, automated ground point classification erroneously included known
                    vegetation (i.e., understory, low/dense shrubs, etc.). These points were
                    manually reclassified as non-grounds. Ground surface rasters were developed from
                    triangulated irregular networks (TINs) of ground points.</para>

            <para>The LiDAR survey uses a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. For the HJ
                    Andrews and Willamette NF study areas, the sensor scan angle was Â±14o from
                    nadir1 with a pulse rate designed to yield an average native density (number of
                    pulses emitted by the laser system) of 8 points per square meter over
                    terrestrial surfaces. All study areas were surveyed with an opposing flight line
                    side-lap of =50% (=100% overlap) to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface
                    laser painting. The Leica ALS50 Phase II system allows up to four range
                    measurements (returns) per pulse, and all discernable laser returns were
                    processed for the output dataset. It is not uncommon for some types of surfaces
                    (e.g. dense vegetation or water) to return fewer pulses than the laser
                    originally emitted. These discrepancies between ânativeâ and âdeliveredâ density
                    will vary depending on terrain, land cover and the prevalence of water bodies.
                    To accurately solve for laser point position (geographic coordinates x, y, z),
                    the positional coordinates of the airborne sensor and the attitude of the
                    aircraft were recorded continuously throughout the LiDAR data collection
                    mission. Aircraft position was measured twice per second (2 Hz) by an onboard
                    differential GPS unit. Aircraft attitude was measured 200 times per second (200
                    Hz) as pitch, roll and yaw (heading) from an onboard inertial measurement unit
                    (IMU). To allow for post-processing correction and calibration, aircraft/sensor
                    position and attitude data are indexed by GPS time</para>

        <accuracyReport>The vertical accuracy of the LiDAR data is described as the mean and standard
                deviation (sigma ~ Ï) of divergence of LiDAR point coordinates from RTK ground
                survey point coordinates. To provide a sense of the model predictive power of the

                These statistics assume the error distributions for x, y, and z are normally
                distributed, thus we also consider the skew and kurtosis of distributions when
                evaluating error statistics. Statements of statistical accuracy apply to fixed
                terrestrial surfaces only and may not be applied to areas of dense vegetation or
