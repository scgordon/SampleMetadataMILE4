    <abstract>
      <para>The objective of this study was to create GIS layers depicting vegetation cover over the history of the small experimental watersheds (WS 1, 2, and 3) based on aerial photography from the 1950s to 1990, for landscape ecology and spatial modeling studies.  Aerial photos were interpreted for hydrologically relevant vegetation types (conifer, broadleaf, grasses and bare soil) cover classes, and forest age class was determined for each year (1959, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1979, and 1990).  Vegetation data for functional groups (conifer, evergreen broadleaf, deciduous broadleaf) was aggregated from species data available in TP073 for the long term vegetation plots in Watershed 1.</para>

          <para>Processing Procedures - TP119</para>
          <para>TP11902: Vegetation cover map for 1967 for Watershed 1
The accuracy of the aerial photo interpretation was assessed through comparison of the percent cover maps against the plot cover measurements. Some differences were expected between the mapped cover percentages and the plot measurement, because of the difference in the resolution of the mapped areas and the 2x2m plot size. The mapped areas were drawn with an expectation that there was significant heterogeneity in the vegetation cover within each map unit. These results are presented in Appendix B of thesis.</para>
          <para>
The 1972 herbaceous cover map agreed with the plot data for 45 plots, and in general overestimated herbaceous cover. The 1972 conifer and evergreen broadleaf cover map agreed with the plot data for 31 plots, and in general overestimated conifer and evergreen broadleaf cover. The 1972 deciduous broadleaf cover map agreed with the plot data for 58 plots, and in general underestimated deciduous cover. The 1979 conifer and evergreen broadleaf cover map agreed with the plot data for 35 plots, and in general overestimated conifer and evergreen broadleaf cover. The 1979 deciduous broadleaf cover map agreed with the plot data for 44 plots, and in general underestimated deciduous cover. The 1990 herbaceous cover map agreed with the plot data for 27 plots, and in general overestimated herbaceous cover. The 1990 evergreen broadleaf cover map agreed with the plot data for 18 plots, and in general overestimated evergreen broadleaf cover. The 1990 conifer cover map agreed with the plot data for 28 plots, and in general overestimated conifer cover. The 1990 deciduous broadleaf cover map agreed with the plot data for 34 plots. These map assessments were not used to adjust the cover map for two reasons. The resolution of the map units was quite a bit larger than the plot size, and there was no discernible spatial pattern in the plot data that could have been used to adjust the cover maps. </para>

      <abstract>
        <para>The H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest is a living laboratory that provides unparalleled opportunities for the study of forest and stream ecosystems in the central Cascade Range of Oregon. Since 1980, as a part of the National Science Foundation Long Term Ecological Research (NSF-LTER) program, the Andrews Experimental Forest has become a leader in the analysis of forest and stream ecosystem dynamics.</para>
        <para>Long-term field experiments and measurement programs have focused on climate dynamics, streamflow, water quality, and vegetation succession. Currently researchers are working to develop concepts and tools needed to predict effects of natural disturbance, land use, and climate change on ecosystem structure, function, and species composition. </para>
        <para>The Andrews Experimental Forest is administered cooperatively by the USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University and the Willamette National Forest. Funding for the research program comes from the National Science Foundation (NSF), US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University, and other sources.</para>

          <descriptorValue>The Andrews Forest is situated in the western Cascade Range of Oregon, and covers the entire 15,800-acre (6400-ha) drainage basin of Lookout Creek. Elevation ranges from 1350 to 5340 feet (410 to 1630 m). Broadly representative of the rugged mountainous landscape of the Pacific Northwest, the Andrews Forest contains excellent examples of the region's conifer forests and associated wildlife and stream ecosystems. These forests are among the tallest and most productive in the world, with tree heights of often greater than 250 ft (75 m). Streams are steep, cold and clean, providing habitat for numerous aquatic organisms.</descriptorValue>

            <para>
Five sets of aerial photos were used to describe temporal and spatial changes in
vegetation cover in WS 1. These sets of photos coincide with periods of interest in the
streamfiow record (1959, 1967, 1972, 1979, &amp; 1990). The photo interpretations
were
based on plant functional groups and resulted in cover maps for each of the plant
functional groups. The cover maps were then used to create vegetation input 'ayers for
MAPSS-W simulations. The photos taken in 1959 and 1967 are black and white and the
photos taken in 1972, 1979, and 1990 are color

To determine the spatial patterns and cover density of each vegetation functional
group, aerial photos were examined as stereopairs. Photos were examined for the three
woody vegetation groups (conifers, deciduous broadleaf and evergreen broadleaf) and
for herbaceous vegetation. The conifer and evergreen broadleaf vegetation were
identified based on canopy shape; shrubs and herbaceous vegetation were
distinguished based on vegetation density and color. Vegetation cover estimates were
determined within 25% cover categories (0-25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, and 75-100%) and,
in areas of scattered deciduous broadleaf canopies, a 10% cover category was added.

      <entityDescription>Vegetation history classification for watersheds 1, 2, and 3 (1959-1990), Andrews Experimental Forest. Photos were interpreted for hydrologically relevant vegetation types (conifer, broadleaf, grasses and bare soil) and forest age class was determined for each year (1959, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1979, and 1990). Vegetation data for functional groups (conifer, evergreen broadleaf, deciduous broadleaf) was aggregated from species data available in TP73 for the long term vegetation plots in Watershed 1.</entityDescription>

      <entityDescription>Vegetation history classification for watersheds 1, 2, and 3 (1959-1990), Andrews Experimental Forest. Photos were interpreted for hydrologically relevant vegetation types (conifer, broadleaf, grasses and bare soil) and forest age class was determined for each year (1959, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1979, and 1990). Vegetation data for functional groups (conifer, evergreen broadleaf, deciduous broadleaf) was aggregated from species data available in TP73 for the long term vegetation plots in Watershed 1.</entityDescription>

      <entityDescription>Two soil surveys exist for the Andrews small watersheds. Soils datasets were developed from both surveys to test model sensitivity to variations in soil variables. The 1964 soil survey is the soils dataset used by most researchers at the Andrews. It was completed in 1964 by a USGS soil survey team andwas available through the Andrews GIS data archive (FSDB). The 1964 survey includes map units of soil series, percent slope, and Iandform (USDA, 1964). This survey was largely based on aerial photo interpretation.Additionally, an intensive soil survey was completed for the Andrews WS 1, 2 &amp; 3 in the 1960's in conjunction with the beginning of the small watershed experiments (Dyrness, 1969). In order to create a dataset from the small watershed survey, the soil survey field map (Dymess et al., unpublished) was digitized using Arclnfo 7.0.4 (ESRI,1996). The small watershed survey includes map units of soil series, soil series phase (based on rock fragment), percent slope, and landform. This survey was based on soil profile and Iandform analysis. Soil series and soil phase profile summaries (Rothacher et al., 1967 &amp; Dyrness, 1969) were used to develop the soil depth, percent rock fragment and texture percentages needed for the modeling datasets. The soil attributes were added to the soil survey maps in Arclnfo 7.0.4 (ESRI, 1996) and each attribute layer was converted to a 30m grid using ArcGrid 7.0.4 (ESRI, 1996) for use in the modeling effort/</entityDescription>

      <entityDescription>Vegetation history classification for watersheds 1, 2, and 3 (1959-1990), Andrews Experimental Forest. Photos were interpreted for hydrologically relevant vegetation types (conifer, broadleaf, grasses and bare soil) and forest age class was determined for each year (1959, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1979, and 1990). Vegetation data for functional groups (conifer, evergreen broadleaf, deciduous broadleaf) was aggregated from species data available in TP73 for the long term vegetation plots in Watershed 1.</entityDescription>

      <entityDescription>This point coverage represents the long term vegetation plots in WS 1. The locations of the plots are based on the GPS locations of the plots at each end of each of the six transects. GPS coordinates were taken using a Trimble Pathfinder GPS unit and were corrected using data from the Portland OR base station. The points along the transects in this coverage were evenly distributed to represent the 30.5m slope corrected spacing of the 2mx2m vegetation plots.</entityDescription>

      <entityDescription>This point coverage represents the long term vegetation plots in WS 1. The locations
        of the plots are based on the GPS locations of the plots at each end of each of the six
        transects. GPS coordinates were taken using a Trimble Pathfinder GPS unit and were corrected
        using data from the Portland OR base station. The points along the transects in this
        coverage were evenly distributed to represent the 30.5m slope corrected spacing of the 2mx2m
        vegetation plots.</entityDescription>

      <entityDescription>This point coverage represents the long term vegetation plots in WS 1. The locations of the plots are based on the GPS locations of the plots at each end of each of the six transects. GPS coordinates were taken using a Trimble Pathfinder GPS unit and were corrected using data from the Portland OR base station. The points along the transects in this coverage were evenly distributed to represent the 30.5m slope corrected spacing of the 2mx2m vegetation plots.</entityDescription>

      <entityDescription>This point coverage represents the long term vegetation plots in WS 1. The locations of the plots are based on the GPS locations of the plots at each end of each of the six transects. GPS coordinates were taken using a Trimble Pathfinder GPS unit and were corrected using data from the Portland OR base station. The points along the transects in this coverage were evenly distributed to represent the 30.5m slope corrected spacing of the 2mx2m vegetation plots.</entityDescription>

      <entityDescription>This point coverage represents the long term vegetation plots in WS 1. The locations of the plots are based on the GPS locations of the plots at each end of each of the six transects. GPS coordinates were taken using a Trimble Pathfinder GPS unit and were corrected using data from the Portland OR base station. The points along the transects in this coverage were evenly distributed to represent the 30.5m slope corrected spacing of the 2mx2m vegetation plots.</entityDescription>

      <entityDescription>This point coverage represents the long term vegetation plots in WS 1. The locations of the plots are based on the GPS locations of the plots at each end of each of the six transects. GPS coordinates were taken using a Trimble Pathfinder GPS unit and were corrected using data from the Portland OR base station. The points along the transects in this coverage were evenly distributed to represent the 30.5m slope corrected spacing of the 2mx2m vegetation plots. The landscape variables include plant communities, soil disturbance, soil type, slope, aspect, and percent cover for conifers, hardwoods, and shrubs, and percent total woody vegetation.</entityDescription>

      <entityDescription>Vegetation history classification for watersheds 2, and 3 (1959-1990), Andrews Experimental Forest. Photos were interpreted for hydrologically relevant vegetation types (conifer, broadleaf, grasses and bare soil) and forest age class was determined for each year (1959, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1979, and 1990). Vegetation data for functional groups (conifer, evergreen broadleaf, deciduous broadleaf) was aggregated from species data available in TP73 for the long term vegetation plots in Watershed 1.</entityDescription>

      <entityDescription>Vegetation history classification for watershed 2 (1959-1990), Andrews Experimental Forest. Photos were interpreted for hydrologically relevant vegetation types (conifer, broadleaf, grasses and bare soil) and forest age class was determined for each year (1959, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1979, and 1990). Vegetation data for functional groups (conifer, evergreen broadleaf, deciduous broadleaf) was aggregated from species data available in TP73 for the long term vegetation plots in Watershed 1.</entityDescription>

      <entityDescription>Vegetation history classification for watersheds 1, 2, and 3 (1959-1990), Andrews Experimental Forest. Photos were interpreted for hydrologically relevant vegetation types (conifer, broadleaf, grasses and bare soil) and forest age class was determined for each year (1959, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1979, and 1990). Vegetation data for functional groups (conifer, evergreen broadleaf, deciduous broadleaf) was aggregated from species data available in TP73 for the long term vegetation plots in Watershed 1.</entityDescription>

      <entityDescription>Vegetation history classification for watersheds 1, 2, and 3 (1959-1990), Andrews Experimental Forest. Photos were interpreted for hydrologically relevant vegetation types (conifer, broadleaf, grasses and bare soil) and forest age class was determined for each year (1959, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1979, and 1990). Vegetation data for functional groups (conifer, evergreen broadleaf, deciduous broadleaf) was aggregated from species data available in TP73 for the long term vegetation plots in Watershed 1.</entityDescription>
